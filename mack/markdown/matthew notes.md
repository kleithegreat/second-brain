## Chapter 3
John the Baptist - inversion
> 13 Then Jesus *arrived from Galilee at the Jordan, coming to John to be baptized by him. 14 But John tried to prevent Him, saying, “I have the need to be baptized by You, and yet You are coming to me?” 15 But Jesus, answering, said to him, “Allow it at this time; for in this way it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.” Then he *allowed Him.

## Chapter 4
The temptation of Jesus - Satan interpreting scripture literally
> 5 Then the devil *took Him along into the holy city and had Him stand on the pinnacle of the temple, 6 and he *said to Him, “If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down; for it is written:
>
> ‘He will give His angels orders concerning You’;
>
> and
>
> ‘On their hands they will lift You up,
> So that You do not strike Your foot against a stone.’”
>
> 7 Jesus said to him, “[b]On the other hand, it is written: ‘You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.’”
- What does "You shall not put the Lord your God to the test." mean?

## Chapter 5
The Sermon on the Mount
> 34 But I say to you, take no oath at all, neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God, 35 nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of His feet, nor [ad]by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. 36 Nor shall you take an oath by your head, for you cannot make a single hair white or black. 37 But make sure your statement is, ‘[ae]Yes, yes’ or ‘No, no’; anything beyond these is [af]of evil origin.
- What does it mean to take an oath by something? 
- What does "yes, yes" and "no, no" mean?

## Chapter 7
> 6 “Do not give what is holy to dogs, and do not throw your pearls before pigs, or they will trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces.
- Seems kinda random? 
- Also what does this mean?

## Chapter 10
> 34 “Do not think that I came to [z]bring peace on the earth; I did not come to [aa]bring peace, but a sword. 35 For I came to turn a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; 36 and a person’s enemies will be the members of his household.
- Is this talking about believers and non believers?

## Chapter 12
> 7 But if you had known what this [d]means: ‘I desire [e]compassion, [f]rather than sacrifice,’ you would not have condemned [g]the innocent.
- Motif of desiring compassion over sacrifice when dealing with the pharisees

> 32 And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, either in this age or in the age to come.
- Mild sarcasm: but the trinity? But Jesus = The Holy Spirit?

## Chapter 13
- All of these parables seem to go against universal salvation?
