1. Case Study: In your own words, **summarize your chosen case (either from this document, from the textbook, or from your own research into electronic music issues). Sticking to facts and a neutral voice, describe the pertinent events and the relevant rights and forms of appropriation involved.** (One paragraph)

In March of 2022, a small reggae band called Artikal Sound System sued English singer songwriter Dua Lipa accusing her of stealing the main melody of Artikal Sound System's "Live Your Life" in Dua Lipas' "Levitating." In the court case, Artikal Sound System specifically said that they believe that Dua Lipa and her co-songwriters listened to their sound "Live Your Life" before writing "Levitating", and that the two songs are so similar that it counts as copyright infringement. Artikal Sound System fought for monetary compensation because they felt that they were entitled to a portion of the profits made from "Levitating", since they feel that it is so similar to their own song. The lawsuit has not been resolved yet.


2. **Argue for one side of the conflict. Explain how one party wronged the other, what should have been done instead, and suggest what should be done to make it right. Consider legal rights as well as ethical principles.** (1–2 paragraphs)

The main melody in the chorus of "Levitating" by Dua Lipa does indeed sound almost identical to the main melody found in "Live Your Life" by Artikal Sound System. Both melodies are in the same key signature, similar tempos, almost the same rhythm, and use the same notes. Because of this, there is a chance that Dua Lipa and her songwriters took inspiration from "Live Your Life" without giving them credit or any compensation. If Dua Lipa and her songwriters did indeed steal ideas from "Live Your Life", they should credit Artikal Sound System as songwriters and also give them a share of the songs royalties. 


3. **Now argue for the other side of the conflict. Explain what legal or ethical principles could work to defend this party’s actions.** (1–2 paragraphs)

The rhythm being accused of being stolen in the lawsuit is so common in music that it has a name: the charleston. The stolen melody in question appears so commonly in music (music before "Live Your Life") that it wouldn't make ethical sense to protect it with copyright, since it is not exactly an original idea. Additionally, it is unlikely that Dua Lipa and her songwriters were able to listen "Live Your Life" before writing "Levitating." Aside from being an obscure band, Artikal Sound System only released "Live Your Life" on vinyl and SoundCloud, which has since been made unavailable.


4. Intercultural Competence: **Identify a conflict (or imagine a potential conflict) resulting from cultural/subcultural differences or other differences in personal values.** Explain. Use the same case study you chose for questions 1–3 if you can.

In the case study about "The Grey Album" by Danger Mouse, protesters who believed that sampling even to an extreme degree should be allowed with a compulsory license came into conflict with the Beatle's label EMI because the label believed that sampling to that degree should not be allowed to exist with a compulsory license.


5. Personal Values: **Explain a common scenario in arts or technology in which someone might give or avoid giving money (or another valuable resource) in exchange for some experience engaging with art. Trace what was given or taken and the legal and ethical principles involved. Describe the impact on the community or art form if everyone participated in this way. Discuss whether and how those decisions align with your relevant personal values. Keep each answer relevant to your overall conclusion.** (One page.)
    - For example, you might give an account of donating when it was not required, pirating when it was not authorized, or participating in an act of civil disobedience.
    - Use a generic or hypothetical scenario, or use pseudonyms for the purpose of discussion. The point is not for you to confess any wrongdoing or accuse others. You will be graded on your analysis of the scenarios discussed, not on any particular actions or beliefs described in the scenarios.

One common scenario in which people avoid giving money for some experience engaging with art is when people pirate music. The listener gains experience with the music. The artist whose music is being pirated loses some royalties along with the record label that they released the music with. If everyone pirated music, more artists would not be able to support themselves with their work, which would also lead to a loss of potential art created, and thus the people who pirate in the first place would not be able to experience music as much or in the same capacity. 


6. Defining Social Responsibility in Art: Finally, **considering the information, beliefs, and conclusions above, define social responsibility as it pertains to art using your own words.** (One focused paragraph.)

Social responsibility as it pertains to art is ensuring that your actions are respectful towards other artists as well as the community or communities that your art belongs to. This definition would include respecting the intellectual property of others, as well as not making spurious claims against other artists that would impede freedom of expression in art.
