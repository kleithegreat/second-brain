\section{Main Idea}

In this problem, there are two types of professional wrestlers: babyfaces (``good guys") and heels (``bad guys"), and between any two wrestlers, there may or may not be a rivalry.
Given $n$ professional wrestlers and a list of $r$ pairs of wrestlers with rivalries, we want to determine whether it is possible to designate some of the wrestlers as babyfaces and the remainder as heels such that each rivalry is between a babyface and a heel in $O(n+r)$ time.

The main idea of the solution is to represent the wrestlers as vertices in a graph, and the rivalries as edges between the vertices.
Then, we use DFS to traverse the graph and assign babyface and heel labels to the vertices.
In the end, if we can assign labels to all the vertices, then we return the labels; otherwise, we return ``No".

\section{Pseudocode}

In this pseudocode, we represent the wrestlers as numbers from 1 to $n$.
Arrays are indexed starting from 1.
The graph $G$ is represented as an adjacency list, where $G[i]$ is the list of vertices adjacent to vertex $i$.
We assume that $r$ is a list of pairs of wrestlers with rivalries, where each pair is represented as a tuple $(u, v)$.
We have an array of labels $labels$ where the index $i$ corresponds to the label of wrestler $i$.
