\begin{problem} ($10+10=20$ points) Section 1.1, Exercise 1.3.
For (b), give the knight's graph in a text format by giving all
edges in the graph such that the knight's move from vertex $v_i$ to 
vertex $v_{i+1}$ is given as $(v_i, v_{i+1})$.  Once you have all of the
edges written, you can also give the path in the form of 
$v_i - v_{i+1} - v_{i+2} - \ldots$

Use the common convention of expressing the columns and rows of
a chessboard as a, b, and c, and 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}

Part (a). Put simply, there are not enough squares on a 3x3 chessboard that would allow a knight to make a full tour without revisiting at least one square.

Part (b). The knights graph of a 3x3 chessboard is the following: (a1,b3), (a1,c2), (a2,c1), (a2,c3), (a3,b1), (a3,c2), (b1,a3), (b1,c3), (b3,a1), (b3,c1), (c1,a2), (c1,b2), (c2,a1), (c2,a3), (c3,a2), (c3,b2). 
In in the form of $v_i - v_{i+1} - v_{i+2} - \ldots$, the knight's graph is a1-b3-c1-a2-c3-b1-a3-c2-a1. It is clear from this representation that there is no way to visit all 9 squares without revisiting at least one square. This is because the maximum length of any path in this graph is 8 , which is one less than the total number of vertices.

\begin{problem} (20 points) Section 2.3, Exercise 2.26.
Your answer should consist of a series of logical equivalences 
you learned in the text, and the final step must resolve to $T$.
Do not use a truth table.  Study the proofs of Proposition 2.8 (b) and (c) 
for the expected style of your answer.  Watching the video ``Problem 
Solving Exercise 1" in Module {2.1} will also be helpful.

Example \LaTeX\ source for how to align the steps nicely is shown 
in the truth-table.tex and truth-table.pdf files.
