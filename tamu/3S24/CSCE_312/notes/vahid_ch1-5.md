# 1 - Introduction

## 1.1 Digital Systems in the World Around Us
Blah blah blah computers are small and they help us do things.

## 1.2 The World of Digital Systems
### Digital versus Analog
- A **digital** signal is discrete
    - It can only take on a finite number of values
    - Example: number of fingers you can hold up
- An **analog** signal is continuous
    - It can take on any value in a range
    - Example: temperature outside
- Computing systems typically use digital signals that are on or off
    - This is called binary
- A **digital system** is a system that takes digital inputs and makes digital outputs
- A **digital circuit** is a circuit that uses digital components to make a digital system
- A single binary digit is called a **bit**

#### Digital Circuits are the Basis for Computers
- Digital circuits let us build microprocessors
    - Microprocessors serve as the brain for general purpose computers

#### Digital Circuits are the Basis for Much More
- More and more new applications convert analog signals to digital signals
    - This can result in numerous benefits
        - Easier to store and transmit
        - Easier to process
        - Easier to combine with other digital signals
        - Lack of degradation over time
        - Compression
    - Devices such as cell phones, digital cameras, and MP3 players use digital circuits to convert analog signals to digital signals
- Digital circuits found in applications that are not computers are called **embedded systems**
- Analog to digital conversion is called **digitization**
- Digital to analog conversion is called **digital to analog conversion**

### Digital Encodings and Binary Numbers - 0s and 1s
