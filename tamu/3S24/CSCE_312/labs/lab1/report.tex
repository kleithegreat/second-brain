\section{Problem 1}

\subsection{Part A}
\textbf{Tag 1: } The purpose of this code is to make sure that the file is open, or the point to the file is not null. 
If the file is not open, then the program will exit.\\
\textbf{Tag 2: } This code calls the \lstinline!gettimeofday()! function from the \lstinline!time.h! header.
It then assigns the value to the \lstinline!this_instant! variable which is passed by reference. \\
\textbf{Tag 3: } \\
\textbf{Tag 4: } \\
