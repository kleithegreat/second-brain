\begin{enumerate}[1.]
    \item An irrational number is a real number that cannot be expressed as a ratio of integers, such as a fraction.
    \item If $x$ and $y$ are real numbers, with $x$ less than $y$, then there exists a rational number $r$ such that $x$ is less than $r$ and $r$ is less than $y$.
    \item Pure mathematics topics often turn out to have applications, such as number theory in cryptography.
    \item The function $f$ is differentiable everywhere.
    \item A real number greater than or equal to 0 is nonnegative.
