# Higher-order Functions
Higher-order functions allow for common programming patterns to be encapsulated as functions.
## 7.1 Basic concepts
- As seen before, functions with multiple arguments are typically defined as curried functions.
- This uses the fact that functions can return functions as results.
- It is also permissible to define functions that take functions as arguments.
- For example, 
## 7.2 Processing lists

## 7.3 The foldr function

## 7.4 The foldl function

## 7.5 The composition operator

## 7.6 Binary string transmitter

## 7.7 Voting algorithms
