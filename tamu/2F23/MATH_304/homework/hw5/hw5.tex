\section*{Question 1}
Consider the following collections of polynomials in $\mathbb{P}_2$:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item $p_1(x) = 1, \quad p_2(x) = x + 1, \quad p_3(x) = x^2$.
    \item $p_1(x) = x - 1, \quad p_2(x) = x + 1, \quad p_3(x) = x^2 - 1$.
    \item $p_1(x) = x^2 - 1, \quad p_2(x) = x^2 + 1, \quad p_3(x) = x^2$.
\end{enumerate}
Decide in each case if these vectors are linearly independent.
Write the dimension of the subspace $S := span\{p_1, p_2, p_3\}$ in each case.
In which case(s) would we have that $S = \mathbb{P}_2$? Explain your answer.

\medskip
\noindent
\textbf{Answer:} To check for linear independence, we can use the Wronskian determinant.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item
        \begin{flalign*}
            W(p_1, p_2, p_3) = \begin{vmatrix} 1 & x + 1 & x^2 \\ 0 & 1 & 2x \\ 0 & 0 & 2 \end{vmatrix}
            = 2 \begin{vmatrix} 1 & x + 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{vmatrix}
            = 2 &&
        \end{flalign*}
        \newline
        Since $W(p_1, p_2, p_3) \neq 0$, the vectors are linearly independent.
        The dimension of the subspace $S := span\{p_1, p_2, p_3\}$ is 3, since there are 3 linearly independent vectors in its basis.
        \newline
        In this case, we have that $S = \mathbb{P}_2$.
        \begin{proof}
            To show that $S = \mathbb{P}_2$, we need to show that $span\{p_1, p_2, p_3\} = \mathbb{P}_2$.
            Let $p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ be an arbitrary polynomial in $\mathbb{P}_2$.
            Our goal is to show that $p(x)$ can be shown as a linear combination of $p_1, p_2, p_3$.
            That means we must find $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ such that:
            $$ \alpha p_1(x) + \beta p_2(x) + \gamma p_3(x) = ax^2 + bx + c $$
            Substituting in $p_1, p_2, p_3$, we have:
            $$ \alpha + \beta(x + 1) + \gamma x^2 = ax^2 + bx + c $$
            $$ \alpha + \beta x + \beta + \gamma x^2 = ax^2 + bx + c $$
            $$ \gamma x^2 + \beta x + (\alpha + \beta) = ax^2 + bx + c $$
            Equating coefficients, we have:
            $$ \gamma = a, \quad \beta = b, \quad \alpha + \beta = c $$
            Since $\beta = b$, we have that $\alpha = c - b$.
            Substituting everyting back into the original equation, we have:
            $$ (c - b) + b(x + 1) + ax^2 = ax^2 + bx + c $$
            Now we can see that $p(x)$ can be written as a linear combination of $p_1, p_2, p_3$.
            Therefore, $span\{p_1, p_2, p_3\} = \mathbb{P}_2$, and $S = \mathbb{P}_2$.
        \end{proof}
    \item
        \begin{flalign*}
            W(p_1, p_2, p_3) &= \begin{vmatrix} x - 1 & x + 1 & x^2 - 1 \\ 1 & 1 & 2x \\ 0 & 0 & 2x \end{vmatrix}
            = 2x \begin{vmatrix} x - 1 & x + 1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{vmatrix} && \\
            &= 2x (x - 1 - x - 1) = -4x &&
        \end{flalign*}
        \newline
        Since $W(p_1, p_2, p_3) \neq 0$, the vectors are linearly independent.
        The dimension of the subspace $S := span\{p_1, p_2, p_3\}$ is 3, since there are 3 linearly independent vectors in its basis.
        \newline
        In this case, we have that $S = \mathbb{P}_2$.
        \begin{proof}
            To show that $S = \mathbb{P}_2$, we need to show that $span\{p_1, p_2, p_3\} = \mathbb{P}_2$.
            Let $p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ be an arbitrary polynomial in $\mathbb{P}_2$.
            Our goal is to show that $p(x)$ can be shown as a linear combination of $p_1, p_2, p_3$.
            That means we must find $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ such that:
            $$ \alpha p_1(x) + \beta p_2(x) + \gamma p_3(x) = ax^2 + bx + c $$
            Substituting in $p_1, p_2, p_3$, we have:
            $$ \alpha(x - 1) + \beta(x + 1) + \gamma(x^2 - 1) = ax^2 + bx + c $$
            $$ \alpha x - \alpha + \beta x + \beta + \gamma x^2 - \gamma = ax^2 + bx + c $$
            $$ \gamma x^2 + (\alpha + \beta) x + (\beta - \alpha - \gamma) = ax^2 + bx + c $$
            Equating coefficients, we have:
            $$ \gamma = a, \quad \alpha + \beta = b, \quad \beta - \alpha - \gamma = c $$
            Now we have arbitrary elements $a, b, c$ in terms of $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$.
            To solve for $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ in terms of $a, b, c$, we can use the augmented matrix:
            $$ \left[\begin{array}{ccc|ccc}
                0 & 0 & \gamma & a & 0 & 0 \\
                \alpha & \beta & 0 & 0 & b & 0 \\
                -\alpha & \beta & -\gamma & 0 & 0 & c
            \end{array}\right] $$
            Using row operations, we have the following equivalent matricies:
            
        \end{proof}
    \item
        \begin{flalign*}
            W(p_1, p_2, p_3) &= \begin{vmatrix} x^2 - 1 & x^2 + 1 & x^2 \\ 2x & 2x & 2x \\ 2 & 2 & 0 \end{vmatrix}
            = 2 \begin{vmatrix} x^2 - 1 & x^2 + 1 \\ 2x & 2x \end{vmatrix} && \\
            &= 2 (2x^3 - 2x - 2x^3 - 2x) = -8x &&
        \end{flalign*}
        \newline
        Since $W(p_1, p_2, p_3) \neq 0$, the vectors are linearly independent.
        The dimension of the subspace $S := span\{p_1, p_2, p_3\}$ is 3, since there are 3 linearly independent vectors in its basis.
        \newline
        In this case, $S \neq \mathbb{P}_2$, since none of the polynomials in $S$ have a term of degree 1.
        Therefore, there is no way to represent a polynomial of degree 1 as a linear combination of $p_1, p_2, p_3$.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Question 2}
Consider the following collections of smooth functions $[0,1]$:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $f_1(x) = x^2$, $f_2(x) = \frac{1}{x^2}$
    \item $f_1(x) = \cos(x)$, $f_2(x) = \sin(x)$
    \item $f_1(x) = 1$, $f_2(x) = \frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2}$, $f_3(x) = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{2}$
\end{enumerate}
Decide in each case if these vectors (functions) are linearly independent.

    \item $u_1 = (1,2)^T$, $u_2 = (2,5)^T$
