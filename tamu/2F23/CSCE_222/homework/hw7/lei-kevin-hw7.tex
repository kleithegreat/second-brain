\begin{problem} (20 points) Section 13.1, Exercise 13.4. Explain your reasoning 
carefully, including (but not limited to) why you set up your generating function 
in the way you do.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
We know that albert must receive an even amount of cards that is at least 8 and at most 14.
To represent this with a generating function, we can use the following:
$$ A(z) = z^8 + z^{10} + z^{12} + z^{14} $$
Here, the coefficient of $z^k$ represents the number of ways to give Albert $k$ cards.
The same applies for Bella and Clara, but we have different restraints on the number of cards they can receive.
Bella and Clara can both receive an odd number of cards that is at least 3 and at most 9.
Therefore, we have the following:
$$ B(z) = z^3 + z^5 + z^7 + z^9, \quad C(z) = z^3 + z^5 + z^7 + z^9 $$
To find all combinations that satisfy the given conditions, we can multiply the generating functions together,
and then find the coefficient of $z^{20}$, since Grandpa Dell has 20 cards to give out.
\begin{align*}
A(z)B(z)C(z) &= (z^8 + z^{10} + z^{12} + z^{14})(z^3 + z^5 + z^7 + z^9)(z^3 + z^5 + z^7 + z^9) \\
             &= x^{32} + 3x^{30} + 6x^{28} + 10x^{26} + 12x^{24} + 12x^{22} + 10x^{20} + 6x^{18} + 3x^{16} + x^{14} \\
[z^k]A(z)B(z)C(z) &= 10
\end{align*}
Thus, we have 10 different ways to give out the cards.
\end{solution}

\newpage
\begin{problem} (15 points) Section 13.2, Exercise 13.7. Explain.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
The sequence $(1, 0, 1, 0, ...)$ can be represented by the following generating function:
$$ A(z) = 1z^0 + 0z^1 + 1z^2 + 0z^3 + ... $$
since the first term is 1 which corresponds with $z^0$, and the second term is 0, and so on.
This can be simplified as:
$$ A(z) = 1 + z^2 + z^4 + z^6 + ... $$
In summation notation, this can be represented as:
$$ A(z) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} z^{2k} $$
Since this is a geometric series with common ratio $z^2$ and first term 1, the closed form is:
$$ A(z) = \frac{1}{1 - z^2} $$
The multiplicative inverse of a generating function must multiply with the original generating function to be identically 1.
This means the multiplicative inverse of $A(z)$ is simply just:
$$ B(z) = 1 - z^2 $$
\end{solution}

\newpage
\begin{problem} ($15+15=30$ points) Section 14.2, Exercise 14.10.
\textit{Explain} your steps carefully.\\[.5ex]
For (a), study carefully how the example in Section 14.2 is solved using generating 
functions, and solve it in a similar way. (Be reminded that a ``closed form'' means a 
rational function that does not use a power series.)\\[.5ex]
For (b), do the partial fraction decomposition of $H(z)$ and expand it into a sum of 
two power series and then combine them into a power series to find the coefficient 
for the $z^k$ power term (like we did for the Fibonacci recurrence in the problem 
solving video and in the lecture notes).
