## Experimental error
- error leads to uncertainty in answers, which places limits on designs in engineering
- error is the difference between the measured and expected/calculated value
    - engineers must be able to recognize types of errors
        - true, fractional, percent
        - systematic vs random
- accuracy vs precision:
    - accuracy is closeness to expected value
    - precision is closeness between measurements
- accuracy is an issue of calibration, precision is an issue of design
- uncertainty of single measurements are limited by the measuring instrument
    - eg. the tick marks on a ruler
> we will avoid single measurements in ENGR 216

## Plotting data
- histograms help visualize spread in a data set
> generally, use more than 6 bins and no more than 15

> in this course, data will be recorded in csv and manipulated in python

## Descriptive Statistics
- help represent data and graphs more concisely, summarizes data set
- does **not** infer conclusions beyond observed data
    - inferential statistics are generalizations about data
- statistics assumes that data follows the normal distribution
    - 3 ways to describe center, 3 ways to describe variation
