moment for L shape: 9.7 +/- 0.7 * 10^-4 kg * m^2
moment for mass: 1.32 +/- 0.05 * 10^-6 kg * m^2
mass is 20 g

assignment:
1. plot of angular momentum of lshape, mass, and total system before and after drop
2. moments of inertia for circle and pentagon shape

angular velocity is found as a finite difference after recentering cartesian coordinates around the rotating point and converting to polar. 
standard error for initial and final angular velocities then propagate?
