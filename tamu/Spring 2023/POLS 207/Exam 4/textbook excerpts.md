## Bathroom Use
In a one-day specially convened session on March 
23, 2016 North Carolina’s legislature passed a 
sweeping law that reversed a Charlotte ordinance 
that had extended some rights to people who are 
gay or transgender. The law passed by the General 
Assembly and signed that same night by Gov. Pat 
McCrory goes further than a narrow elimination 
of Charlotte’s ordinance, which had generated 
the most controversy by a change that protected 
transgender people who use public restrooms based 
on their gender identity. The new law also nullified 
local ordinances around the state that would have 
expanded protections for the LGBT community.36 
This action by North Carolina ignited a nationwide 
controversy over bathroom use despite no evidence 
that there were problems with individuals’ choices 
of bathrooms in Charlotte, in North Carolina or in 
the United States.  The status of legislation in the 
states is depicted in Figure 8.8. On May 9, 2016, Texas Lt. Governor Dan 
Patrick called for the resignation of Fort Worth 
Independent School District Superintendent Dr. 
Kent Scribner over guidelines outlining bathroom 
use. “Campus safety should be of paramount con-
cern for anyone in his position,” Patrick said in a 
statement. “Every parent, especially those of young 
girls, should be outraged.”37 The Fort Worth Independent School District 
guidelines specified that schools must ensure 
students feel safe in their restrooms. If a student 
is uncomfortable using the bathroom with a trans-
gender peer, the school must let the student use a 
single-stall restroom, a gender-neutral bathroom or 
a restroom where no one else is present.38 The Fort Worth ISD had been discreetly 
handling the bathroom gender issue in the same 
way for at least 16 years without any problems, 
according to a district official who explained the 
history of its background.  The issue comes up 
perhaps “one time a year” in a district with tens 
of thousands of students.  The Fort Worth ISD 
policy was adopted in 2011 with extensive public 
input, according to former City Council member 
Joel Burns.  A school official said the 2011 policy 
was strengthened as a result of an anti-bullying 
campaign launched nearly a decade earlier.  The 
anti-discrimination policy adopted by the district in 
April 2014 specifically addressed gender identifica-
tion.39 Fort Worth School Board President Jacinto 
“Cinto” Ramos issued a statement in response to 
criticism of the school district by Lt. Governor 
Patrick and individuals and groups both inside and 
outside the school district.  “Rest assured, the safe-
ty of ALL children is our highest priority on the 
Board. We are completely capable of handling this 
in Fort Worth. We are applying the existing policy 
to make sure ALL children feel safe at school. We 
are here to look out for ALL children; not some, 
not most, but ALL children.” On May 30, 2016, Lt. Governor Dan Patrick 
on Tuesday escalated his battle against guidelines 
in Texas and across the country that allow students 
to use the bathroom that corresponds with their 
gender identity. Patrick announced a number of 
new moves in the offensive, including a request 
for an opinion from Texas Attorney General Ken 
Paxton on whether the Fort Worth Independent 
School District broke the law when it adapted such 
guidelines. Patrick also said he was sending a letter 
to all Texas school districts advising them to ignore 
a similar directive issued this month by the feder-
al government. Throughout his remarks, Patrick 
suggested that state lawmakers would have to step 
in if Fort Worth ISD did not reconsider its actions. 
He also repeatedly pushed back on the idea that he 
was intruding on a local matter, saying it was “this 
superintendent and school board that is prohibiting 
local control.”40 Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton actively 
sought to bring a case against the federal govern-
ment.  Three days after the federal government 
released guidelines instructing school districts 
to let transgender students use the bathroom that 
corresponds with their gender identity members of 
Paxton’s staff approached the Wichita Falls school 
board about pursuing a lawsuit on May 16.  Board 
members ultimately decided against passing a poli-
cy that would make them party to a lawsuit against 
the federal government.  Wichita Falls Superinten-
dent Michael Kurht agreed with the school board, 
citing legal council that the school district’s current 
policies were in compliance with the new federal 
guidelines.41 Ten days after the Wichita Falls board meet-
ing, Paxton announced that he had filed a lawsuit 
against the Obama administration to protect a 
different North Texas school district.  At the same 
press conference, Harrold Independent School 
District Superintendent David Thweatt said the 
attorney general approached him about the policy, 
which his school board adopted three days earlier.42 
The school board unanimously passed a policy that 
mandated students use the bathroom that corre-
sponds to their gender at birth.43 The Harrold school district has never had a 
transgender student among the 100 or so who 
attend as far as anyone can remember. But schoolofficials decided to pass a policy limiting bathroom 
access based on a person’s birth certificate any-
way.44 Alabama, Wisconsin, West Virginia, Ten-
nessee, Arizona’s Department of Education, Maine 
Gov. Paul LePage, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Utah and 
Georgia joined Texas in the suit against the federal 
government. President Trump abolished the federal 
guidelines on bathroom use in public schools short-
ly after taking office in 2017. After the elimination of the federal guideline 
and North Carolina’s repeal of its bathroom bill, 
Lt. Governor Patrick made passing a bathroom bill 
one of his highest priorities for the 2017 regular 
legislative session.  The Texas Senate approved 
such a bill, but the Texas House expressed con-
cerns about economic problems in North Carolina 
and did not pass a bathroom bill.  Governor Abbott 
included “privacy” to the agenda of a special ses-
sion he called to begin July 18, 2017. Again in the 
special session, the Senate approved a bathroom 
bill and the House did not.

## Summary
1. Although the institutional formats of our na-
tional and state governments differ little and are 
seldom changed, government at the local level is 
often altered and varies greatly.
2. Local governments include city or municipal 
governments, county governments, school district 
governments, and other special district govern-
ments.
3. Much of the change in local governments is 
directed toward improving efficiency and effec-
tiveness and reducing corruption in government. 
There are many reforms that have been in favor at 
different times, but the “reform movement” of the 
late 1800s and early 1900s is most credited with 
reforming our cities.
4. Strengthening the role of the public in govern-
ment, or at least part of the public, is an explicit 
goal of local government reform. Most often, 
reforms seek reducing the role of politicians and 
enhancing the role of “better” elements of society, 
such as businessmen, women, and developers.
5. The little we know about how local govern-
ments differ suggests minimal causal impact of 
institutions on their elections, politics, or policies.
6. The principle of government closest to the peo-
ple governs best is always supported in principal 
by Texas state officials but not always practiced.

## Problems of Geographic Representation
The costs or liabilities of geographic representa-
tion were not great at one time. When government 
did not do much, there was little cost to gathering 
the necessary information to cast an informed vote 
and little reason to bother. Even the costs of being 
uninformed or misinformed were minor. More-
over, in a district where most grew their own food, 
natural events, such as the lack of rain, poor soil, 
or threatening insects, would affect all equally. In 
modern society, however, we pay high costs for 
geographic selection of representatives.  Chief among these costs is the difficulty of rep-
resenting a heterogeneous district rather than the 
more homogeneous districts that once were com-
mon across the country. With a complex economy, 
most geographic districts now include constituents 
who share unanimously few views, if any. They 
are not equally affected by either natural events or 
by government policies directed at such events. A 
district may include poor farmers eager to sell their 
products at high prices and poor workers eager to 
buy farm products at low prices. It may contain 
many unemployed workers hoping to have extend-
ed unemployment insurance and owners of small 
businesses barely able to make a living because of 
present state taxes. This mix of different people is 
what we call a heterogeneous district. A substantial minority of farmers or industrial 
workers within a district may cause their represen-
tatives to support policies that those constituents 
favor. The ignored majority of voters may have lit-
tle choice but to endure their lack of representation. 
But what if the representatives’ personal opinions 
favor them? As in so many other areas, the grow-
ing complexity of society has greatly complicated 
the procedures for selecting representatives as well 
as the actions of those representatives.  Modern efforts to retain geographic districts 
while making them ethnically more homogeneous further aggravate the problem. To draw districts 
that include many minorities, it is often necessary 
to assemble pockets of minorities spread broad-
ly across a state into districts that resemble bugs 
splattered on our car windshields. People in these 
districts may share little other than skin color; they 
may have little sense of who shares their district 
or a sense of community in the district. Moreover, 
the surrounding non-minority districts may share 
little other than the fact that they are not minority 
districts. Most modern districts lack compactness 
and any sense of identity. Political scientists have often stressed that 
heterogeneous districts force the representative and 
his or her supporters to compromise even to win 
elections, and that this is essential to democracy. 
We have a continuing dilemma. Homogenous dis-
tricts make representation easier but force compro-
mise to take place after elections; heterogeneous 
districts make representation difficult, especially 
for minorities, but encourage compromise to win 
voter support before elections. The winner of a heterogeneous district must 
appeal to a broad range of voters and opinions. To 
do so, he or she might say nothing of substance, 
thus offending the fewest people. Examples of 
such candidate statements include the following: 
“It is time for a change!” “Let’s get America mov-
ing!” “Everyone should feel safe on our streets!” 
and “Let’s get back to what made America great!” 
Some states may have homogeneous districts, but a 
great division of opinion may exist between those 
districts. We do not know if they experience diffi-
culty in reaching the compromises that are neces-
sary to make public policy.
Alternatives for Selecting Representatives
Given modern literacy and communication tech-
nologies, we need not retain the procedures for 
selecting representatives that once were necessary. 
We certainly no longer need to gather prospective 
voters to hear candidates’ appeals face to face. 
Although it is expensive, candidates depend on 
television and new style, negative campaigns 
costing many times more than what their elected 
positions pay in salaries. A candidate who can look 
like a “statesman” and appear “wise and honest,” 
as compared to the opponent who is “tricky” and 
just a “politician” is most likely to win. If interest 
groups are willing to supply the money for such 
campaigns, all is well for incumbent legislators 
desiring to continue in office. They can win re-
election time after time. Are they representative, 
however? Reelection may have nothing to do with 
how representatively a legislator acts. Although it is not commonly used, technology 
now allows for vote gathering other than by having 
people visit polling places. Beginning in World 
War II, the states began to allow absentee voting by 
mail for those out of town on Election Day. Oregon 
is now using such mail ballots for its elections, and 
neighboring Washington has most voters voting 
that way. San Diego and other local governments 
have experimented with voting by mail. As dis-
cussed in Chapter 6, these efforts have made voting 
more convenient but have not increased voter turn-
out. Much of our daily banking is conducted with-
out interacting in person with bank personnel. 
Customers can use bank machines available at 
many locations. They can also do business at the 
locations of their choice through computers or 
telephones. Similar procedures for vote gathering 
could make voting as easy as visiting a website, 
making a telephone call, or visiting the counterpart 
of a cash card machine. Voters would no longer 
need to gather at polls. Though geographically 
based districts were once technologically neces-
sary, they are not the only option. Such districts are 
hard to represent. Most districts have few interests 
shared by the large majority of their populations. 
Perhaps we should consider alternatives to basing 
representation exclusively on geography.
Non-Geographic Districts
With available computer technology and social 
data, governments now could assign segments of 
society likely to share opinions on governmental 
policies to virtual districts. If one-quarter of the 
state is agricultural, farmers could select one-quar-
ter of the representatives. If appropriate, farmers 
could be further divided by acreage in production, 
income, or other factors. Similarly, if wealthy 
businessmen were to constitute only 2 percent of 
the state, they might get to choose only a single 
representative if legislative seats were apportioned 
based on occupation and income. Race, gender, 
and age are other bases on which such a system might be constructed.  There is no question that there would be diffi-
culties implementing such a system, but they are 
not insurmountable. Certainly many segments of 
society that are currently over-represented would 
oppose any such restructuring of procedures for se-
lecting representatives. The purpose of abandoning 
geographic representation would be to increase the 
probability that representatives will be like those 
they represent. Bias among present representatives, whether 
they are legislators, executives, or judges, will be 
a focus of our concern in the next several chap-
ters. But while we are considering changes in the 
procedures of representation, let us be even more 
fanciful.
Entrepreneurial Representatives
Cyberspace social networking sites such as Face-
book could serve as models for a system of entre-
preneurial representation. Prospective legislators 
could solicit constituents similar to the way social 
networks encourage friendships. Each qualified 
voter could affiliate with one self-nominated candi-
date for the legislature during a specified campaign 
period. In a state with 150 members of its House of 
Representatives, the 150 candidates with the great-
est number of affiliated voters would take office. 
Individual candidates might be successful without 
the backing of any political party. The existing electoral advantage of candidates 
with personal wealth or wealthy supporters might 
be as strong in an entrepreneurial system as in our 
current system. If expensive mass media continue 
as the main arenas of campaigning, then entrepre-
neurial representation may not change the makeup 
of legislatures. We think another outcome is pos-
sible. Individuals could be successful by making 
themselves and their candidacies “viral.” Instead 
of the most important resources being campaign 
contributions and familiar partisan talking points, 
individual initiative and creativity could become 
paramount. Parties may become less important as 
individuals create their own constituencies based 
on contemporary common interests more than 
longstanding partisanship. Cyberspace social networking could also serve 
as a model for legislators to communicate with 
their affiliates and others. Transparency of effort 
and success would occur for individual legislators. 
Legislative compensation could be linked to size 
of affiliated voters. If representatives had one vote 
and one dollar a year in pay for each voter’s proxy 
they held, some representatives’ ideas and pro-
grams would attract many proxies and substantial 
income. Of equal importance, the unrepresentative 
and unresponsive could not survive.
Randomly Selected Representatives
Finally, we could simply choose our representa-
tives by random selection. Within the limits of 
sampling error, every characteristic of the public 
would then be reflected within the halls of govern-
ment. This would be somewhat similar to the way 
we presently select a pool of individuals as poten-
tial trial jurors, except that all would be eligible, 
none could be stricken for bias, and the sample 
would be the same size as the number of seats in 
the legislature. Legislative compensation could be commensu-
rate with the responsibilities that selected legisla-
tors undertook or were assigned. Representatives 
responsible for multi-billion dollar governments 
could be paid what private sector boards of direc-
tors or managers in companies of comparable size 
are paid. Perhaps the term of office would need to 
be limited to 1 or 2 years. Very few would have the 
luck of being selected, but all but the most extreme 
should find their ideas present in government. Only 
the most popular ideas, however, would be likely 
to become policy. Would those holding minority 
ideas accept majority-based decisions without 
having the opportunity to hear their side expressed 
in debate? Would seeing and hearing your opinions 
expressed by someone you could not vote against 
satisfy you? Each of these proposals for representation 
based on something other than the traditional ge-
ography model has problems that would need to be 
resolved. Each achieves representatives that better 
reflect the characteristics of the governed. Each 
better copes with the complexity of modern life 
and employs tools we now have to communicate 
and gather preferences for certain policies. We 
challenge the reader to consider the advantages and 
disadvantages of state and local government that is 
truly representative of the entire population.

## The Virtues of a Professional Legislature
Since, with the exception of Nebraska, all states 
use the same three-reading-plus-conference pro-
cedures, we cannot say whether alternative proce-
dures might improve enacting quality legislation. 
There is, however, a difference among the states 
in terms of how much this entire process is com-
pressed into a limited number of days.  All state legislatures began as Citizen Legisla-
tures. They were intended to meet for short periods 
of time to conduct the people’s business. Members 
were essentially volunteers. They received little 
compensation other than personal expenses in-
volved in meeting at state capitols. It was expected 
that they would serve a term or two before with-
drawing. The opposite style is Professional Legislatures. 
Instead of meeting for short sessions, Professional 
Legislatures meet year round. Members certainly 
do not act volunteers. They are well compensated 
for their services with salaries, expense accounts 
and generous retirement benefits. They are ex-
pected to have residences in the state capitol as 
well as in their home districts. Professional Leg-
islatures provide help for members in the form of 
staff for both home and district offices. There are 
also staffs for individual committees and services 
for research, bill drafting, information technology, 
public relations, and so on. Hybrid legislatures combine elements of the 
other two styles. In hybrid legislatures, the work-
load expands in doing the publics’ business but 
outside employment is still the norm. Figure 9.5 
maps the three styles used by state legislatures.  No 
regional patterns are evident.35 Figure 9.6 shows how the three styles of legis-
latures differ on session lengths, workloads of bills 
introduced and enactments. Citizen legislatures are 
generally on the low end, hybrid legislatures are in 
the middle and professional legislatures are on the 
high end, as expected.
The Impact of Professionalism
Figure 9.7 presents correlations between legislative 
professionalism and characteristics of legislators 
Figure 9.5
Legislative Styles
to assess whether professionalism has an impact 
on who serves. There are no relationships between 
legislative professionalism and gender or racial/
ethnic group percentages. There are no relation-
ships with turnover of legislators or with interpar-
ty competition of partisan control. We can only 
conclude that level of legislative professionalism 
is not systematically related to who serves in state 
legislatures.36 Figure 9.7 also presents correlations between 
legislative professionalism and workloads. More 
professional legislatures have longer legislative 
sessions, an element of the professionalism index.  
Professionalism is negatively related to percent of 
bills enacted. Professionalism is unrelated to num-
ber of bills introduced and number enacted. If the reformers advocating the Profession-
al Legislature style are correct, states with more 
professional legislatures should have better pubic 
policies. Their argument is the superior research 
capability, quality law-drafting, thorough debate, 
and expertise of professional full-time legislatures 
result in such better decisions. The opposing view 
is that Citizen Legislatures should make better de-
cisions. The reasoning is that amateur legislatures 
are closer to and more like their constituents. They 
are more representative. The result should be better 
public policies because legislatures make decisions 
preferred by their constituents. We cannot measure 
“better” policies, but we measure different policies 
in Figure 9.8.  The correlations in Figure 9.8 offer scant evi-
dence that legislative professionalism is systemat-
ically related to state policies.  Professionalism is 
positively related to tax burdens.  It is not related 
to other financial measures, including revenue, ex-
pensive, tax regressivity and debt. It is unrelated to 
reliance on personal or corporate income taxes. It 
is unrelated to welfare and education sending and 
unrelated to abortion policies. Those who argue that more professional legis-
latures produce better policies could legitimately 
argue that our measures of professionalism are 
imperfect and our measures of policies are incom-
plete. We agree. However, at this point, we con-
clude only that convincing empirical support for 
their argument based on contemporary state differ-
ences has yet to be made.

## Summary
1. The legislative branch not only is expected to 
check and balance the executive branch in making 
public policy but also is expected to represent con-
stituents. Representation is difficult to achieve.
2. Although it was once necessary given commu-
nication difficulties and illiteracy, geographically 
based selection of legislators is no longer neces-
sary and no longer allows representatives to have a 
consistent constituency that is easy to represent.
3. State legislatures apportion their states’ pop-
ulations into both state upper chamber (senate) 
and lower house districts and U.S. congressional 
districts. The drawing of district lines can greatly 
disadvantage the minority party that has little say 
in the matter. Recent court decisions have in-
creased the likelihood that partisan considerations 
will dominate how legislative districts are drawn in 
the future.
4. The process of enacting a bill involves the 
“three-reading” procedure that was adopted from 
England. By conventional measures, few bills pass 
the hurdles of this procedure. State legislators say 
killing bad bills is more important than passing 
legislation.
5.  There is insufficient empirical evidence to 
support the contention that states with more and 
less professional legislatures pursue systematically 
different policies.
6. The representativeness of legislatures varies 
greatly in terms of representing women and mi-
norities. No one state or group of states stands out 
as most representative.
7. Some policies are linked to better representa-
tion of women. The relationships are not necessari-
ly causal.
8. The relationships between policies and party 
control of legislatures for a single year reported in 
Chapter 7 are largely found when party control is 
measured over a much longer period of time.
