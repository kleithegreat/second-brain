## Beliefs vs facts
- beliefs should not be confused as facts - important for a republican democracy
- beliefs can be based on facts, but ultimately go beyond pure facts
- it can be dangerous if beliefs are confused as facts
    - savvy citizens must be able to differentiate the two
    - beliefs are passed off as facts very commonly (even in government)
- beliefs are important, which means **all** beliefs are important (not just ours)
    - understanding others is critical for interation, cooperation, and competition
    - understanding others benefits our communities as well as our own effectivness in our political involvement
- tale of two groups:
    - political actors (politicians, media, etc.)
        - goal - they intend to **seek power** - intended to change policy, advance careers, hold/gain audience, etc.
        - entice people to agree with them using whatever means possible
            - partial truths/lies
            - out of context information
            - incomplete information
        - it is NOT THEIR JOB to tell the truth, they will do whatever to achieve their goal
    - political scientists
        - goal - **scientifically** seek the best **empirical** information to **transparently** explain events/behavior
        - goal - increasing funding for research and publish findings, increase standing in their field of study
        - it is their job to produce **trustworthy** findings
            - HOWEVER, findings can be *contradictory*
            - some of the most pressing questions are very hard to study
            - scientists are also human, they are still susceptible to greed and bias (even unconscious)

## Distinguishing between beliefs and facts
- research who they are and why they are speaking
    - assess their motives and likely biases
- listen with the intent to understand, then analyze critically
    - look for:
        - factual correctness
        - factual completeness
        - factual context
        - underlying meanign

## Subconscious cognitive biases
- These are shortcuts our brains take which skew facts to fit our beliefs
- biases vs heuristics
    - biases are **always bad** - they skew our views
    - heuristics are good when they reduce our time to make decisions
    - confirmation bias
        - cherry picking information that fits our existing views
    - implicit bias
        - subconsciously ascribing negative characters to something
    - avaliability heuristic
        - we tend to use the most recent information even if it is not the best information
    - representative beuristic
        - assuming additional characteristics based of some given information without having any other basis

## Winners and loses in politics
- every political decision will produce winners and losers
- these can be groups or individuals
- typically a trade off between today and tomorrow

## Winners and losers in Texas
- Texas politics has long been dominated by non-hispanic (NH) whites for a long time
    - 65% of Texas legislators are NH white
    - 41% of Texas are NH white
        - overrepresentated in the state legislature
- demographics show this will likely change in the future
    - models project the hispanic population to overtake the NH white population in proportion
    - significant difference in proportion by 2050\
    - non hispanic whites make up more old people and less young people
        - NH white proportion decreases for younger populations
    - trends in demography take **very long** to come and go
