# CHAPTER 11A

### 1. Compare and contrast the following aspects of criminal and civil law:  (some information will be further along in the slides that others)
- **Origin of cases**
    - Criminal law cases originate from the violation of a law or statute, whereas civil law cases originate from disputes between private parties or entities.
- **Parties involved and their objectives**
    - In criminal law cases, the government prosecutes the defendant for committing a crime, seeking punishment such as imprisonment or fines. In civil law cases, one party (the plaintiff) sues another party (the defendant) for compensation or specific performance.
- **Percent of cases that go to trial**
    - A higher percentage of civil cases tend to go to trial compared to criminal cases, as most criminal cases are resolved through plea bargaining.
- **Location of trials**
    - Both criminal and civil trials can occur in state or federal courts, depending on the jurisdiction and the nature of the case.
- **Bases of decisions/outcomes**
    - In criminal cases, the jury or judge must find the defendant guilty "beyond a reasonable doubt." In civil cases, decisions are based on the "preponderance of the evidence," which means that the plaintiff must prove it is more likely than not that the defendant is liable.

### 2. Overview the prosecution process under criminal law.
The criminal prosecution process generally involves the following stages: investigation, arrest, initial appearance, preliminary hearing or grand jury, arraignment, plea bargaining, trial, sentencing, and appeals. Each stage has its own set of procedures and protections to ensure that the accused receives a fair trial.

### 3. Describe the similarities and differences between the two types of criminal offenses in Texas.
In Texas, criminal offenses are classified as either misdemeanors or felonies. Both involve a violation of the law and potential punishment. Misdemeanors are less severe offenses, punishable by fines and/or incarceration in a local or county jail. Felonies are more serious offenses, punishable by imprisonment in state prison or, in some cases, death.

### 4. Using the fallen-tree example, highlight the aspects of the civil trial process that are unique from a criminal one.
In a fallen-tree scenario, a civil trial might involve a plaintiff suing a neighbor for damages caused by the fallen tree. This would involve proving negligence or fault, a preponderance of the evidence standard, and an outcome in the form of monetary compensation. A criminal trial, on the other hand, would involve the government prosecuting the neighbor if a law was violated, such as an environmental regulation or criminal negligence, with potential criminal penalties.

### 5. Discuss the case loads of both federal and state courts and explain the differences.
State courts handle the vast majority of cases in the United States, including criminal, civil, family, and probate matters. Federal courts have a more limited jurisdiction, generally handling cases involving federal law or constitutional issues, as well as disputes between parties from different states. As a result, state courts have a much larger caseload than federal courts.

### 6. Describe the hierarchy of three main groups of state courts.
The hierarchy of state courts typically consists of trial courts, intermediate appellate courts, and the state supreme court. Trial courts are the entry point for most cases, handling both criminal and civil disputes. Intermediate appellate courts review decisions made by trial courts to ensure the law was applied correctly. The state supreme court is the highest court in the state and hears appeals from the intermediate appellate courts, often focusing on issues of statewide importance.

### 7. Explain the types of questions considered in each of these levels.  Provide examples.  Also explain the implications of a type of question NOT being considered at a particular level.
**Trial courts:** These courts consider questions of fact and law, such as determining the facts of a case and applying the relevant law. If a question is not considered at this level, it may lead to an unfair trial or an incorrect application of the law.   
**Intermediate appellate courts:** These courts review trial court decisions and consider questions of law, such as whether the trial court correctly interpreted and applied the law. If a question is not considered at this level, it could result in an erroneous decision being upheld.   
**State supreme courts:** These courts often focus on questions of significant legal or public policy importance. If a question is not considered at this level, it may leave unresolved legal issues or inconsistencies in the law.

# CHAPTER 11B:

### 1. Describe or draw out the diagram that shows all of the types and subtypes of courts in Texas.  Include the flows of appeals from all of the lower courts.
- **Municipal Courts and Justice of the Peace Courts:** These are limited jurisdiction courts that handle minor criminal and civil cases. Appeals from these courts go to the County Courts.
- **County Courts:** These courts handle more serious misdemeanor cases, probate matters, and civil cases with lower monetary values. Appeals from these courts go to the Courts of Appeals.
- **District Courts:** These are the primary trial courts with general jurisdiction, handling felony cases, civil cases with higher monetary values, and family law cases. Appeals from these courts go to the Courts of Appeals.
- **Courts of Appeals:** 14 intermediate appellate courts that review decisions from the District and County Courts. Appeals from these courts go to the Texas Supreme Court (for civil cases) and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (for criminal cases).
- **Texas Supreme Court and Texas Court of Criminal Appeals:** These are the highest courts in Texas, with the Supreme Court handling civil cases and the Court of Criminal Appeals handling criminal cases.

### 2. In general terms, differentiate between the roles and the jurisdictions of each of these courts.  (Use the lecture as your guide as to level I’m expecting.)
- **Municipal Courts:** Handle Class C misdemeanors, municipal ordinance violations, and traffic infractions.
- **Justice of the Peace Courts:** Handle minor civil disputes, small claims, and Class C misdemeanors.
- **County Courts:** Handle more serious misdemeanors, probate cases, and civil cases with lower monetary values.
- **District Courts:** Handle felony cases, civil cases with higher monetary values, and family law cases.
Courts of Appeals: Review trial court decisions for errors of law.
- **Texas Supreme Court and Texas Court of Criminal Appeals:** Resolve important legal questions and ensure consistency in the application of state law.

### 3. Describe how state residents participate in the judicial system and how they are selected.
State residents participate in the judicial system primarily through jury service and voting in judicial elections. Jurors are selected randomly from voter registration lists, driver's license records, and other sources. Potential jurors are then summoned to court, where they may be questioned by the attorneys and the judge to determine their suitability for a specific case.

### 4. Explain the issues with fairness and peremptory strikes in jury trials.  Discuss whether this is a partisan issue.
Fairness and peremptory strikes in jury trials can be an issue because attorneys can use peremptory strikes to remove potential jurors without providing a reason. This can lead to discrimination or bias in jury selection. While the Supreme Court has ruled that peremptory strikes cannot be used solely based on race or gender, proving such discrimination can be difficult. This is not necessarily a partisan issue, as concerns about fairness and discrimination can be shared across the political spectrum.

### 5. Discuss the qualifications of attorneys and judges/justices in Texas.
In Texas, attorneys must have a law degree and pass the state bar exam. Judges and justices must be licensed attorneys and meet specific age and residency requirements. Additionally, they must have a certain number of years of legal experience, which varies depending on the level of the court.

### 6. Compare and contrast the systems that US states use to select their judges/justices.  Explain why there may be differences within a given state as to the selection method for trial courts and for appellate courts.
US states use various methods to select judges/justices, including partisan elections, non-partisan elections, appointment by the governor or legislature, and merit selection (followed by retention elections). Differences within a given state as to the selection method for trial courts and appellate courts may arise due to historical factors, regional variations, or differing views on the importance of judicial independence and accountability at different levels of the judiciary.

### 7. Describe the “Choose Well” video, including its strengths and weaknesses.

# CHAPTER 11C:

### 1. Based on the “Red, White, and Blue” video, explain the rationales provided for appointing or electing judges/justices.
The rationales for appointing or electing judges/justices vary. Proponents of appointment argue that it promotes judicial independence, reduces the influence of politics, and ensures that qualified and experienced candidates are selected. Advocates for election argue that it promotes accountability, allows the public to have a say in the judiciary, and ensures that judges/justices are representative of the communities they serve.

### 2. Based on the Democracy Now! video, describe how campaigns have changed in state judicial races and how and why this may threaten the fairness of the courts.
In recent years, campaigns in state judicial races have changed in ways that may threaten the fairness of the courts. Increasingly, these races have become more expensive and politically charged, with outside interest groups spending large sums of money to influence the outcomes. This trend raises concerns about the impartiality and integrity of elected judges, who may feel pressure to rule in favor of their donors or align their decisions with the political views of their supporters.

### 3. Based on the article by former-Chief-Justice Cobb, discuss the role of campaign donations in a state with elected judges/justices, their effect on the judiciary, and the expectations of donors.
In states with elected judges/justices, campaign donations can play a significant role in shaping the judiciary. Donors may expect judges to rule in their favor or to adopt specific legal interpretations. This creates a potential conflict of interest for judges, who may be influenced by the need to raise funds for their campaigns and appease donors rather than focusing solely on the merits of the cases before them.

### 4. Describe the two examples she provided about judicial conduct in Texas that was unethical, but legal.


### 5. Describe the distribution of executions in the US since 1977.  Characterize the frequency of executions in Texas since 1996.
Since 1977, the distribution of executions in the US has been highly concentrated in a few states, with Texas leading the nation in executions. Texas has consistently had a high frequency of executions since 1996, often executing more individuals in a single year than many other states combined.

### 6. Discuss Judge Price’s dissent in the Panetti appeal, including his rationale and the reasons it could be thought-provoking.


### 7. Explain the reasons that capital punishment is losing US public support.
Capital punishment is losing US public support for several reasons, including concerns about the possibility of executing innocent people, the high costs associated with death penalty cases, racial and socioeconomic disparities in the application of the death penalty, and doubts about its deterrent effect.

### 8. Discuss the disagreement between the conservative researcher and the National Research Council report on whether the death penalty has a measurable deterrence effect. 
The disagreement between the conservative researcher and the National Research Council report revolves around the question of whether the death penalty has a measurable deterrence effect on crime. The conservative researcher argues that the death penalty does deter crime, while the National Research Council report suggests that there is no conclusive evidence to support this claim.

### 9. Describe the problems posed for the death penalty by the timeline, expense, and errors in these capital cases.
The problems posed for the death penalty by the timeline, expense, and errors in capital cases include lengthy and costly appeals processes, a high risk of executing innocent individuals, and concerns about the fairness and effectiveness of the criminal justice system.

### 10. Use the example of the capital crime in Van Zandt County to illustrate those problems.


### 11. Discuss the frequency and reasons for exonerations.  Discuss the role of DNA and non-DNA factors in the three cases of Texans previously imprisoned for crimes they did not commit.
Exonerations occur for various reasons, including new evidence, misconduct by law enforcement or prosecutors, and ineffective assistance of counsel. DNA evidence has played a crucial role in many exonerations, proving the innocence of individuals who were wrongfully convicted. Non-DNA factors can also contribute to exonerations, such as new witness testimony or evidence of misconduct.

### 12. Characterize the exonerations US-wide in capital cases since 1973.
Since 1973, there have been over 180 exonerations in capital cases in the United States. These exonerations often involve individuals who spent years, sometimes even decades, on death row before being proven innocent. Many of these cases reveal significant flaws in the criminal justice system, such as inadequate legal representation, prosecutorial misconduct, and false or coerced confessions.

### 13. Discuss the recent spikes in exonerations in Texas.  Also list the number of death-row exonerations within the state.
There have been recent spikes in exonerations in Texas, often attributed to advancements in DNA testing, the creation of dedicated legal organizations working on wrongful conviction cases, and increased scrutiny of the criminal justice system. As of 2021, there have been 13 death-row exonerations in Texas.

### 14. Highlight why the judiciary should matter to state residents.
The judiciary matters to state residents for several reasons. It upholds the rule of law, protects individual rights, and ensures the fair administration of justice. Judges and justices make decisions that can have significant impacts on individuals' lives and the broader society, interpreting laws, and resolving disputes.

# CHAPTER 12 INTRO

### 1. Describe the range and variety within the concept of policy.
Policy encompasses a wide range of issues and approaches, including government regulations, laws, programs, and initiatives that address societal problems or promote specific goals. Policies can vary in scope, complexity, and effectiveness, depending on the issue and context.

### 2. Explain how silence can be a policy and how it achieves its intended outcome.  Do the same for “doing nothing” as policy.
Silence can be a policy when the government chooses not to address an issue or take action, allowing the status quo to continue. This can achieve its intended outcome by signaling that the government does not view the issue as a priority or by allowing existing societal forces to dictate the outcome. Similarly, "doing nothing" as a policy can also maintain the status quo and send a message about the government's priorities.

### 3. Discuss the policy cycle along with pertinent examples and questions at each step.
*Problem identification:* Recognizing an issue that requires action.   
*Agenda setting:* Prioritizing issues and deciding which ones to address.   
*Policy formulation:* Developing potential solutions and strategies.   
*Policy adoption:* Choosing and implementing a specific policy.   
*Policy implementation:* Executing the policy and ensuring compliance.   
*Policy evaluation:* Assessing the effectiveness of the policy and making adjustments as needed.

### 4. Explain the components of the 3-P analysis framework, its objectives, examples of each component, and how it overlays the policy cycle.
The 3-P analysis framework consists of three components: Problem, Process, and Policy. The framework aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of a policy issue by examining the nature of the problem, the processes through which policies are developed and implemented, and the specific policies themselves. This framework can be overlaid on the policy cycle to guide analysis and decision-making at each stage.

### 5. Describe the basic policy questions when it comes to poverty, healthcare, education, and immigration policy answered by states in general, and by Texas specifically.
*Poverty:* What is the role of the government in addressing income inequality and providing a social safety net?   
*Healthcare:* How should healthcare be financed, and what role should the government play in ensuring access to healthcare services?   
*Education:* What is the government's responsibility in providing public education, and how should resources be allocated to ensure equal opportunities?   
*Immigration:* What policies should be in place to regulate immigration, and how should the government address issues related to undocumented immigrants?
States and Texas specifically may answer these questions in different ways, depending on their political, social, and economic contexts.

### 6. Explain how recognizing our own areas of advantage and disadvantage in society can be important when considering policy options.
Recognizing our own areas of advantage and disadvantage in society is important when considering policy options because it allows us to better understand the potential impacts of policies on different groups and to consider issues of fairness and equity.

### 7. Discuss the connections between winning, losing, and worth.
The connections between winning, losing, and worth involve understanding that some individuals or groups may benefit from certain policies (winning), while others may be negatively affected (losing). Policy debates often involve discussions of worth, or what society values and prioritizes when making decisions about winners and losers.

### 8. Describe how our policy preferences can depend on our knowledge of who is not winning and why this is so.
Our policy preferences can depend on our knowledge of who is not winning (disadvantaged groups) because understanding the challenges faced by these groups can inform our views on what policies are necessary to address their needs. Recognizing the reasons for their disadvantage allows us to advocate for policies that promote equity and address systemic issues that contribute to disparities in society.

# CHAPTER 12A1

### 1. Explain the concept of poverty as both a relative and ubiquitous condition.
Poverty is both a relative and ubiquitous condition. As a relative condition, it refers to the state of having significantly fewer resources or income compared to others within a society. As a ubiquitous condition, poverty exists in every society, regardless of overall wealth or economic development, and affects people across different cultural, social, and economic backgrounds.

### 2. Compare and contrast generational and situational poverty and their non-monetary effects.
Generational poverty refers to a cycle of poverty passed down through multiple generations within a family, often due to systemic factors and a lack of access to resources. Situational poverty is temporary and arises due to a specific event or circumstance, such as a job loss or health crisis. Both types of poverty can have non-monetary effects, such as psychological stress, social stigma, and reduced educational and career opportunities.

### 3. Describe how hidden rules work and are different based on one’s socio-economic status.
Hidden rules are unspoken social norms and expectations that govern behavior and interactions within different socio-economic groups. These rules can vary based on one's socio-economic status, influencing communication styles, values, and decision-making.

### 4. Define the poverty measure used by the federal and state governments, then describe the problems associated with it, how they came about, and why they likely won’t be fixed soon.
The poverty measure used by the federal and state governments is the Federal Poverty Level (FPL), which is based on household income and family size. The FPL has several problems, such as not accounting for regional variations in the cost of living, excluding non-cash benefits, and not adjusting for changes in living standards over time. These issues arose due to the measure's reliance on outdated assumptions and methodologies. The FPL is unlikely to be fixed soon because of political resistance and bureaucratic inertia.

### 5. Explain what Francis Deviney’s group devised as an alternative measure of poverty and how it compared to the official measure.


### 6. Characterize the prevalence of official poverty among wage workers and the education levels of those who are officially impoverished.
Official poverty is prevalent among wage workers, particularly those with lower levels of education. Individuals with less education are more likely to work in low-paying jobs and face higher rates of unemployment, contributing to higher rates of poverty.

### 7. Describe the general frequency of residents making at or less than the poverty line, as well as between the poverty line and 2-times that amount in the 10 states with the most low-wage workers.  [IMPORTANT NOTE: Despite what I may have said in the recording from last Spring, these two amounts are cumulative.  For example, if 30% of the workers in a state make at or below the FPL, and 40% of the workers make between FPL and double the FPL, the 70% of the workers in that state make no more than double the FPL!]
The general frequency of residents making at or less than the poverty line, as well as between the poverty line and 2-times that amount, in the 10 states with the most low-wage workers can be quite high. For example, if 30% of workers in a state make at or below the FPL, and 40% make between the FPL and double the FPL, then 70% of the workers in that state make no more than double the FPL.

### 8. Describe what a “low-wage” job is and how low-wage differs from minimum-wage.
A "low-wage" job refers to a job that pays significantly less than the median wage in a given area. Low-wage jobs are distinct from minimum-wage jobs, which pay the lowest legally allowable wage. Low-wage jobs may pay above the minimum wage but still provide insufficient income for a decent standard of living.

### 9. Describe the prevalence of low-wage jobs in Texas and how the lack of full-time hours and absence of benefits contributes to poverty in Texas.
Low-wage jobs are prevalent in Texas, with many workers employed in sectors like retail, food service, and hospitality. The lack of full-time hours and absence of benefits in many of these jobs contribute to poverty in Texas, as workers struggle to make ends meet and have limited access to essential services like healthcare.

### 10. Explain the disconnect between overall economic health of Texas and the economic security of its residents. 
The disconnect between the overall economic health of Texas and the economic security of its residents can be attributed to factors such as income inequality, a high prevalence of low-wage jobs, and limited access to affordable housing, healthcare, and education. While Texas may have a strong economy overall, many residents still struggle to achieve financial stability and economic security.

### 11. Define liquid-asset poor and how this is a problem for even middle-class families.
Being liquid-asset poor refers to a lack of sufficient liquid assets such as cash, savings, or other easily accessible financial resources to cover basic living expenses for a certain period, typically three months. This is a problem for even middle-class families because, without a financial cushion, they are vulnerable to unexpected expenses or emergencies, which can lead to debt, financial instability, or even poverty.

# CHAPTER 12A2

### 1. Describe the concerns of demographers connecting the changes in the makeup of Texas related to ethnicity, education quality, and economic potential.
Demographers are concerned about the changes in Texas's makeup related to ethnicity, education quality, and economic potential because these changes could impact the state's future workforce, economy, and social dynamics. A growing, diverse population may require different educational and social services, and failing to address these needs could limit the state's economic potential.

### 2. List the standard policy tools used by states in varying degrees to address poverty among their residents.
Standard policy tools used by states to address poverty include cash assistance programs (e.g., Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF), food assistance programs (e.g., Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP), housing assistance, healthcare programs (e.g., Medicaid), education and job training programs, and minimum wage policies.

### 3. Characterize the count and rate measures of poverty between 1960 and 2014.  Explain the differences between the two measures over this same period.
Between 1960 and 2014, the count of individuals living in poverty increased, reflecting population growth. The poverty rate, which measures the percentage of the population living in poverty, fluctuated over time, with some periods of increase and decrease. The differences between these two measures highlight the importance of considering both the number of people in poverty and the proportion of the population in poverty when analyzing trends.

### 4. Characterize the poverty rate by race and ethnicity, as well as by age group, over the same period from 1960-2014.
Over the period from 1960-2014, poverty rates varied significantly by race and ethnicity, with higher rates among African Americans and Hispanics compared to whites. Poverty rates also varied by age group, with children and seniors often experiencing higher poverty rates than working-age adults.

### 5. Describe in which regions of the US were the states with the highest and lowest rates of poverty in 2014.
In 2014, states with the highest poverty rates were predominantly located in the South, while states with the lowest poverty rates were found in the Northeast and Midwest regions of the US.

### 6. Describe where Texas ranked in percent population in poverty among US states in 2014 and the state’s overall, deep, and child poverty rates in the same year.
In 2014, Texas ranked among the top 15 states with the highest percent population in poverty. The state's overall poverty rate was around 17%, with deep poverty (those with incomes below 50% of the federal poverty level) at approximately 7%, and child poverty close to 25%.

### 7. Explain why poverty rates are often unexpectedly high in college towns.
Poverty rates are often unexpectedly high in college towns because many students have limited income while pursuing their education, which can skew poverty statistics. These rates may not accurately reflect the financial situation of the broader community.

### 8. Explain the correlations between welfare-related spending and poverty rates in the US states, as well as what this can mean about the effectiveness of poverty reduction efforts?
The correlation between welfare-related spending and poverty rates in the US states can be complex. Some states with higher spending may have higher poverty rates, indicating that poverty reduction efforts may not be as effective as intended. Alternatively, states with higher poverty rates may allocate more resources towards welfare programs in response to greater need.

### 9. Describe how TANF worked in Texas in 2012:  who was eligible, how much assistance they could receive.  Compare this to neighboring states that border Texas.
In 2012, TANF in Texas provided assistance to low-income families with children, as well as pregnant women in their last trimester. Eligible families could receive up to $260 per month for a family of three. Neighboring states had similar eligibility criteria, but the assistance amount varied (e.g., Oklahoma provided up to $292 per month).

### 10. Explain how TANF functions as a federal block grant and where and why Texas chooses to allocate and not allocate its TANF funds.  Discuss how Texas compares to other states and the recent trends in Texas TANF spending.
TANF functions as a federal block grant, giving states flexibility in allocating funds. Texas has chosen to allocate TANF funds towards cash assistance, child care, and work programs, while not allocating as much towards transportation or education. Texas's TANF spending is relatively low compared to other states, and recent trends show a decrease in spending.

### 11. Explain how inflation has affected TANF block grants since 1997, when they started.
Since 1997, when TANF block grants started, inflation has eroded the value of the grants. Because the grant amounts have not been adjusted for inflation, the purchasing power of these grants has decreased over time. This has resulted in reduced assistance for families in need.

### 12. Characterize how families on TANF or TANF and SNAP were faring as %s of the federal poverty level in Texas and other regions of the US.
Families on TANF or TANF and SNAP generally fare below the federal poverty level. In Texas and other regions of the US, these programs typically provide support that lifts families' incomes to some extent but often still leaves them below or near the poverty threshold. The extent to which these programs alleviate poverty depends on various factors, including state policies and the amount of assistance provided.

### 13. Describe key questions that are important to consider when evaluating current or future poverty-reduction policies.
Key questions to consider when evaluating current or future poverty-reduction policies include: What are the specific goals of the policy? What is the evidence supporting the effectiveness of the policy? Who are the intended beneficiaries, and are they being reached? What are the costs associated with implementing the policy, and do they justify the benefits? What unintended consequences may arise from the policy?

### 14. Describe the various influences that can affect our attitudes about social-safety-net policies.
Various influences can affect our attitudes about social-safety-net policies, including personal experiences, political ideology, media coverage, cultural beliefs, and perceived fairness of the policies. These factors can shape how we view the necessity, effectiveness, and impact of social-safety-net policies.

### 15. List actions that individuals can take to become better informed about poverty and its impact in their state and locality.
Actions individuals can take to become better informed about poverty and its impact in their state and locality include researching local poverty statistics, reading news articles and research studies about poverty and its causes, attending community meetings or forums, engaging in discussions with diverse groups of people, and volunteering with organizations that work to address poverty.

# CHAPTER 12B1

### 1. Describe the difference between viewing healthcare as a privilege vs. a right.
Viewing healthcare as a privilege means that access to healthcare services is dependent on an individual's ability to pay or their insurance coverage. In contrast, viewing healthcare as a right means that everyone should have access to healthcare services regardless of their ability to pay or their insurance status.

### 2. Compare and contrast the private care model and the socialized care model.
The private care model involves healthcare providers and insurance companies operating as private entities. In this model, individuals purchase health insurance from private insurers, and the cost of care is largely determined by market forces. The socialized care model, on the other hand, involves government provision or funding of healthcare services. In this model, healthcare is financed through taxes, and the government plays a significant role in regulating healthcare costs and services.

### 3. Explain how most Americans that can afford healthcare manage to do so.
Most Americans who can afford healthcare do so through employer-sponsored health insurance, individual private health insurance, or government-sponsored programs like Medicare and Medicaid.

### 4. Describe how healthcare insurance works in general.
Healthcare insurance works by pooling resources from a large group of people who pay premiums. The insurance company uses these funds to pay for medical expenses incurred by the insured individuals. In this way, the risk of high medical costs is spread across the group, making healthcare more affordable for each individual.

### 5. Explain what healthcare insurance companies must consider carefully to stay in business.
Healthcare insurance companies must carefully consider factors like setting premium rates, estimating healthcare costs, managing risk, and controlling administrative expenses to stay in business. They need to balance these factors to remain financially viable while providing affordable coverage to their customers.

### 6. List and explain the various costs associated with healthcare insurance and how these usually vary with low-cost vs. high-cost policies.
The various costs associated with healthcare insurance include premiums, deductibles, co-payments, and coinsurance. Low-cost policies generally have lower premiums but higher deductibles, co-payments, and coinsurance, while high-cost policies have higher premiums but lower out-of-pocket costs.

### 7. Explain how individuals with healthcare insurance can still end up paying directly for some of their healthcare.
Individuals with healthcare insurance can still end up paying directly for some of their healthcare through deductibles, co-payments, and coinsurance. These costs represent the insured person's share of the medical expenses, which they must pay before the insurance company covers the remaining costs. Additionally, some services may not be covered by insurance, requiring the individual to pay for them out-of-pocket.

### 8. Calculate the monthly healthcare costs for 4 months for the individual with the HDP policy on Slide 13.  Specify each of the categories into which these costs fall:  premium, deductible, co-pay, and out-of-pocket.  If it helps, use the bucket concept from the Consumer Reports video. 
- a) Use a premium of $250, a deductible of $1500, a monthly cost of $150 for medications, and the $650 urgent-care visit in month 2 only.

- b) Use a premium of $250, a deductible of $3000, a monthly cost of $150 for medications, and the $650 urgent-care visit in months 1, 3, and 4.

### 9. Use the numbers you calculated in #8 to explain the risks of HDP health insurance.


### 10. Using the 2013 Milliman Medical Index, describe the different parts of the breakdown of the annual medical costs for a middle-class family of four, and who pays for each part.  Characterize the overall and component costs.


### 11. Explain the nature and size of the increase in medical costs for that same notional family between 2002 and 2013. 


### 12. Describe the percentage of Americans with unpaid medical bills and the relationship between these bills and personal bankruptcies in the US.


### 13. Explain the trend between 2008 and 2012 in how Americans were obtaining or forgoing health insurance.  Describe the possible role of the Great Recession in those trends.


### 14. Compare and contrast the 2008-2012 picture with the 2001-2017 trends in types of health insurance and who pays for it.


### 15. Describe how types of jobs, and types of healthcare plans affect the availability of affordable, high-quality healthcare for Americans.


# CHAPTER 12B2

### 1. Describe the inherent problems associated with delaying or avoiding necessary healthcare, as well as those connected to seeking indigent care in hospital emergency rooms.


### 2. Explain who the ACA is designed to help, how it does so, and why it is not free for the participants.


### 3. Explain who Medicaid is designed to help, how it does so, and how the federal-state partnership works.


### 4. Map out the Texas Medicaid caseload and costs based on the 3 major groups of recipients.  Describe patterns that are present.


### 5. Describe how individuals, based on their income,  obtained healthcare before and after ACA.


### 6. Describe the players that helped craft the ACA and their motivations.


### 7. List the changes to healthcare insurance that ACA caused, even though many Americans don’t realize that the ACA was the reason.


### 8. Explain the state mandate in the ACA, the Supreme Court decision regarding it, and the situation that was created.


### 9. Characterize the various positions of the states on the ACA-sanctioned expansion of Medicaid.  Do the same for the variations in percentages of uninsured residents in each state and note any patterns with each state’s position on expansion.


### 10. Describe the nature of the shift in states’ positions on expansion between 2013 and 2018.


### 11. Describe the positions of the Texas populace and the Texas Legislature regarding Medicaid expansion here.


### 12. Explain the profile that Texas uses to determine who is eligible for Medicaid in the state, as well as how it would change if Texas decided to expand Medicaid access under the ACA.  Discuss how this highlights the conservative values that Texas references for not expanding.


### 13. Discuss the gap in provision of healthcare in states like Texas that have not expanded Medicaid.  Characterize which states and regions have residents that fall into this gap.


### 14. Describe the various reasons that Texas politicians have given for not expanding Medicaid in the state.  Explain possible counterpoints for each.
