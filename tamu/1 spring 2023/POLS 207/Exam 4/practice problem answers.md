# CHAPTER 8A
1. Local governments in the US vary in size and scope, with some being quite small and others much larger. Between 1957 and 2007, the number of local governments increased, though there was a slowdown in the rate of growth after the 1970s. This change can be attributed to factors like population growth, urbanization, and the increasing demand for services.

2. There is not a straightforward relationship between the population of a state and the number of local governments within it. Texas, Kansas, and Nevada illustrate this complexity, as they each have different population sizes and numbers of local governments. Factors like geography, political culture, and historical development influence the number of local governments in a state.

3. In 2010, own-source revenue for the average local government came from several sources, including property taxes, sales taxes, and user fees. These revenues were used to fund various local services and infrastructure.

4. Spending by the average local government in 2010 was allocated across various sectors such as education, public safety, transportation, and health and welfare. The breadth of spending varies depending on local needs and priorities.

5. Historically, county governments in the US served as administrative arms of state governments. Today, they often serve dual purposes, providing both regional services and functioning as local governments in unincorporated areas.

6. Typical roles within a US county government include elected officials like county commissioners, a sheriff, a county clerk, and a tax assessor-collector. County governments also employ various staff to provide services and manage operations.

7. In a Texas county government, voters elect county commissioners, a county judge, and other officials. The county judge and commissioners form the Commissioners Court, which oversees county operations, sets budgets, and makes policy decisions. The pros of this structure include local representation and responsiveness, while the cons include potential inefficiencies and fragmentation.

8. Typical revenue sources for county governments include property taxes, sales taxes, intergovernmental transfers, fees, and fines.

9. Typical expenditures by county governments include public safety, infrastructure, health and human services, education, and general administration.

10. The equity problem in county government expenditures refers to the potential disparities in the distribution of resources and services across different areas within a county, leading to unequal access and benefits for residents.

11. Municipal charters in Texas define the powers, structure, and organization of a municipality. They may be general law charters, which follow state laws, or home rule charters, which allow for greater local control and flexibility.

12. Main types of municipal governments in the US include Mayor-Council, Council-Manager, and Commission forms. Mayor-Council governments are the most common, with Council-Manager forms being the second most frequent.

13. The Mayor-Council type of municipal government consists of an elected mayor and a city council. The mayor's role and powers may vary, but this form is unique due to the separation of executive and legislative responsibilities between the mayor and the council.

14. Strong Mayor-Council governments feature a mayor with significant executive powers, while weak Mayor-Council governments have more limited mayoral powers. Strong forms are more prevalent in larger cities, whereas weak forms are more common in smaller municipalities. Strong forms offer more centralized decision-making, while weak forms emphasize the role of the council in governance.

# CHAPTER 8B
1. The Council-Manager form of local government consists of an elected city council that serves as the legislative body and a professional city manager appointed by the council, who oversees the administration of the city. The city manager is responsible for implementing the council's policies and managing daily operations.

2. The Council-Manager form of local government is prevalent in many Texas cities, particularly in medium-sized and large cities.

3. The city manager in College Station is responsible for overseeing the day-to-day operations of the city, managing city staff, preparing the budget, and implementing policies enacted by the city council. The supervisory and budgetary tasks for the city manager in College Station are significant due to the city's population and diverse range of services provided.

4. Efficiency advantages of the Council-Manager form include professional management of city operations, nonpartisan administration, increased accountability, and more efficient use of resources.

5. In a Council-Manager city, the mayor typically serves as a figurehead and presiding officer at council meetings. The mayor in B/CS has duties such as representing the city at official functions and signing ordinances, resolutions, and other official documents.

6. Single-member seats are elected from specific districts within the city, while at-large seats are elected by the entire city. Single-member seats ensure geographic representation but may encourage parochialism. At-large seats promote citywide interests but may dilute minority representation. The petition to alter the Bryan City Council composition was an example of the winner-loser approach to local politics, as the change could have benefited one group at the expense of another.

7. The Commission form of municipal government consists of a group of elected commissioners, each responsible for overseeing a specific department or function of the city. The commissioners also serve as the legislative body.

8. The Commission form of government was first created in Galveston in the early 20th century as a response to the devastating hurricane of 1900. It was considered innovative as it streamlined decision-making and management by assigning specific responsibilities to commissioners. However, it failed in Galveston and other locations due to lack of coordination and inefficiency resulting from commissioners managing individual departments.

9. Smaller municipalities may prefer the Mayor-Council form for its simplicity, while larger cities might prefer the Council-Manager form for its professional management. In the strong-mayor subtype, the mayor has significant administrative authority, while in the weak-mayor subtype, the mayor's power is more limited and focused on presiding over the council.

10. A Municipal Government Comparison table would compare the different forms of municipal government in terms of their structure, powers, and responsibilities. The table would highlight the differences and similarities between the Council-Manager, Mayor-Council (strong and weak-mayor), and Commission forms of government.

11. Major categories for municipal expenditures include public safety, public works, health and human services, culture and recreation, and general government. Public safety and public works together often make up about half of the budget.

12. The form of government, type of elections, and city size can influence voter turnout, per capita taxes, and other measures. For example, larger cities with more complex governments may have lower voter turnout due to increased difficulty in understanding and engaging with local politics.

13. The empirical relationship between median family income and city taxes paid per capita suggests that as median family income increases, the amount of taxes paid per capita also increases. However, this relationship may not be perfectly predictable, as other factors such as local tax rates and the specific mix of services provided by the city can also affect the taxes paid.

14. The organizational diagram of a school district typically includes a school board, superintendent, and various administrative departments responsible for curriculum, finance, human resources, and other functions.

15. School districts and the council-manager form of government are separate entities. While the council-manager form of government oversees the general administration and operation of the city, the school district is responsible for the administration and operation of public schools within its jurisdiction. However, there can be some overlap in terms of resources, infrastructure, and collaboration on community projects or initiatives.

16. The theoretical relationship between a school board and the school district's superintendent is that the board sets policies and provides oversight, while the superintendent manages the daily operations of the district, implementing the policies set by the board. However, the de facto relationship may differ, with the superintendent often having more influence over policy decisions and the direction of the district than the board. This mismatch can occur due to several reasons, including the superintendent's expertise in educational administration, the part-time nature of school board positions, and the political dynamics within the board. Additionally, the school board members may defer to the superintendent's judgment on various matters, as the superintendent is typically more knowledgeable about the day-to-day functioning of the district.

# CHAPTER 8C
1. The organizational diagram of a special district typically includes a governing board responsible for setting policy and overseeing operations, an executive director or manager for managing day-to-day operations, and various specialized departments and staff that cater to the specific purpose of the district (e.g., water management, transportation, etc.).

2. Special districts serve different purposes, such as providing specific services (e.g., water, sewage, fire protection) or addressing specific local needs. Their jurisdiction is limited by their enabling legislation, and their workers are usually hired and supervised by the governing board or executive director.

3. The original rationales for establishing special districts include providing specialized services that were not available through existing government structures, addressing unique local needs, and promoting efficiency through localized control and focused expertise.

4. Since the 1950s, the incidence of special districts in Texas has grown significantly, with hundreds of new districts being established to address various local needs and challenges.

5. Land developers have learned to use special districts by creating them to fund infrastructure and other improvements for their projects. This can provide personal and professional advantages, such as expedited development processes and tax breaks. However, it can also impose a tax burden on residents, as the cost of infrastructure and services is passed on through property taxes or other fees.

6. Local government jurisdictions overlap when multiple governmental entities have authority or responsibility over the same geographic area or population. This can occur when a city lies within multiple counties or when special districts and general-purpose local governments share responsibility for providing certain services.

7. The inherent conflict between states and their local governments arises from the struggle for power and control over resources, policy, and decision-making. States often seek to exert control over local governments, while local governments strive for autonomy and local control.

9. Conflicts in Texas:

	a. School funding and local debt: Disputes arise over state funding for education, local property taxes, and the level of control local school districts have over their budgets and debt.

	b. Energy production: Conflicts emerge over local control of energy production, particularly regarding regulation of oil and gas drilling.

	c. Bans on discrimination: Disputes arise when local governments enact anti-discrimination ordinances that conflict with state policies or laws.

	d. Bans on plastic shopping bags: Local governments may implement bans on single-use plastic bags, leading to conflicts with state legislation or policies promoting business interests.

	e. Sanctuary laws or behavior: Conflicts arise when local governments adopt sanctuary policies for undocumented immigrants, which may be at odds with state or federal immigration policies.

10. Examples from other states include conflicts over gun control legislation, minimum wage laws, environmental regulations, and marijuana legalization.

11. The types of local-control bills considered in the 2015 Texas legislative session were varied, addressing issues such as plastic bag bans, local fracking regulations, and local control over school start dates.

12. The paradox presented by assertions of local control by a conservative state government is that conservative politicians typically advocate for limited government intervention and local control. However, in instances where local governments enact policies that conflict with conservative values, the state government may seek to override local control. Arguments from both sides involve the balance between local autonomy and the need for uniformity and state control in certain policy areas.

# CHAPTER 9A
1. Across the US states, legislatures are mostly bicameral, with a lower and upper house, such as the House of Representatives and the Senate. Nebraska is the exception, having a unicameral legislature.

2. Conservative legislators might see advantages in signing the Taxpayer Protection Pledge because it demonstrates their commitment to limited government spending and opposition to tax increases. However, the downside is that it may limit their flexibility in addressing budgetary challenges and responding to changing economic conditions.

3. In the Game of Chicken, players can win by convincing their opponent that they will not back down, even in a potentially disastrous situation. Tying hands by signing the Taxpayer Protection Pledge is similar, as it signals to constituents and opponents that the legislator is committed to not raising taxes, which may strengthen their bargaining position. However, this strategy also limits the legislator's options in budget negotiations.

4. High-level functions of a state legislature include making laws, representing constituents, overseeing the executive branch, and allocating funds through budgeting.

5. State legislatures may be seen as more ideal than the US Congress because they are often more responsive to local concerns, have a closer connection to constituents, and are less influenced by national partisan politics.

6. Dave McNeely argued that the legislative system values legislators with expertise in specific policy areas. He also warned against the threat of supermajorities, which can undermine the deliberative and collaborative nature of the legislative process.

# CHAPTER 9B
1. Geographic representation involves dividing a state into districts based on geographic boundaries, with each district represented by one or more legislators. Drawbacks include potential gerrymandering and underrepresentation of certain communities.

2. Since 1963, "equal" divisions of populations have been implemented through redistricting processes, ensuring that each district has approximately the same number of residents, as required by the Supreme Court's "one person, one vote" principle.

3. The phrase "one person, one vote" refers to the idea that each person's vote should have equal weight in elections, which is achieved by ensuring equal population in legislative districts.

4. "Equal population" refers to having roughly the same number of residents in each district, while "equal number of voters" refers to having the same number of eligible voters in each district.

5. Political factors considered when drawing district lines include party registration, voting history, incumbents' addresses, and potential changes in population or demographics.

6. A state's apportionment can be both legally fair and politically unfair if it meets legal criteria such as equal population and compliance with the Voting Rights Act, but still results in partisan advantage or underrepresentation of certain groups due to gerrymandering or other factors.

7. Legal criteria for fair apportionment include equal population, contiguity, compactness, respect for political subdivisions, and compliance with the Voting Rights Act.

8. Protected groups, such as racial and ethnic minorities, are connected to the Voting Rights Act and apportionment in Texas through requirements that redistricting plans do not dilute their voting power or discriminate against them.

9. Maximum partisan advantage in redistricting refers to drawing district lines to favor one party over another, leading to the idea that "politicians pick their voters" instead of the other way around.

10. Gerrymandering is the manipulation of electoral district boundaries to favor a particular political party or group. Its origin dates back to early 19th-century Massachusetts, when Governor Elbridge Gerry approved a redistricting plan that favored his party. It is done through packing (concentrating voters of one party in a single district) and cracking (diluting the voting power of one party across multiple districts).

11. Researchers were able to accomplish a notional reversal of the 2012 congressional election results in Pennsylvania by using a computer algorithm to create alternative redistricting maps. These maps were designed to be more politically neutral while still meeting legal requirements. By simulating the election using the alternative maps, they demonstrated that the election outcome could have been different if not for the gerrymandered districts.

12. The consideration behind whether a district's shape is acceptable or unacceptable often involves factors such as compactness, contiguity, and respect for political subdivisions. Districts that appear irregular or excessively convoluted may be seen as gerrymandered and therefore unacceptable.

13. Strategies used by activists to oppose discriminatory gerrymandering include legal challenges, grassroots organizing, public awareness campaigns, and advocating for redistricting reform measures, such as the establishment of independent redistricting commissions.

14. In LULAC v. Perry, the Supreme Court ruled that Texas' 2003 redistricting plan violated the Voting Rights Act by diluting the voting power of Latino voters in one district. The consequence of the decision was that the state had to redraw the district lines to comply with the Voting Rights Act, but the ruling did not end gerrymandering as a whole.

15. Gerrymandering is not invincible because public opinion, legal challenges, and electoral outcomes can lead to changes in redistricting processes and policies. Additionally, the adoption of alternative redistricting approaches and increased public awareness can limit the impact of gerrymandering.

16. Gerrymandering is a major concern in Texas and other states because it can undermine the principle of fair representation, skew electoral outcomes, and contribute to political polarization.

17. Gerrymandering played a role in Republicans gaining and keeping control of the Texas Legislature by strategically redrawing district lines to favor Republican candidates, dilute Democratic voting power, and protect incumbent Republican politicians.

18. Independent commissions are being used to push back against gerrymandering by taking redistricting decisions out of the hands of partisan politicians and entrusting them to nonpartisan or bipartisan groups. Arizona and Texas are cautionary cases because their experiences show that even with independent commissions, legal challenges, and political interference can still hinder efforts to create fair district maps.

19. Alternative redistricting approaches in the US states include independent commissions, bipartisan commissions, court-ordered redistricting, and algorithm-based redistricting.

20. Proportional voting is considered a better means of resolving the problem of gerrymandering than independent commissions because it can more accurately reflect the political preferences of the electorate and reduce the incentive for politicians to manipulate district boundaries.

21. Congruency models of representation emphasize the importance of legislators sharing the same policy preferences as their constituents, while communication-based models focus on the need for open dialogue and engagement between legislators and constituents to facilitate understanding and responsiveness.

22. Similarities between state legislators and their constituents may include demographic characteristics, political affiliations, and policy preferences. However, legislators may differ from their constituents in terms of education, income, and professional backgrounds.

# CHAPTER 9C
1. Different perspectives on the job of a state legislature include representing constituents, making policy decisions, overseeing the executive branch, and engaging in legislative processes such as introducing and voting on bills.

2. In a typical Texas legislative session, thousands of bills are considered, with many killed in the process. Usually, less than half of the introduced bills are passed.

3. Bills introduced in the Texas House generally have a higher likelihood of success compared to those introduced in the Senate, mainly due to differences in chamber size, rules, and procedures.

4. A successful bill in the Texas legislative process typically goes through the following stages: introduction, referral to a committee, hearings, committee report, scheduling on the calendar, floor debate, passage in the originating chamber, transmission to the other chamber, similar process in the other chamber, conference committee (if needed), final passage in both chambers, and signature by the governor.

5. HBs (House Bills) tend to have a higher success rate within the House, while SBs (Senate Bills) have a higher success rate in the Senate, mainly due to the originating chamber's members being more familiar with their own bills and procedures.

6. State Rep Rainey's strategies to require greater accountability from Blinn College administrators initially failed, as the legislation was killed in the committee stage. However, his efforts succeeded when he attached his proposal as an amendment to another bill, ultimately getting it passed.

7. The legislative process for a bill involves several steps with varying levels of uncertainty and control: introduction, committee assignment, committee hearings, committee vote, calendar placement, floor debate, floor vote, and passage in the other chamber. At each step, different actors like committee chairs, legislative leaders, and rank-and-file members can influence the bill's outcome.

8. The operations tempo in the Texas Legislature starts slow and gradually increases as the session progresses. In the beginning, legislators focus on filing bills and the committees begin holding hearings. As the session continues, the pace picks up, with more bills being considered and voted on by the two chambers. The tempo increases due to deadlines and the desire to pass important legislation before the session ends.

9. The Texas Legislature permits "clones" of bills—multiple versions of the same bill introduced by different legislators. These clones are used to increase the chance of success, as they can be simultaneously advanced through different committees and chamber calendars.

# CHAPTER 9D
1. Readings and calendars play a crucial role in the legislative process, as they determine the order and timing of bill consideration. The Senate's Local and Uncontested Calendar, for example, is a streamlined process for non-controversial bills, allowing for quicker passage.

2. Representative Bristow's conflict arose because he wanted to pass a bill he believed would benefit his constituents but recognized that the bill was unconstitutional. This conflict highlights the tension between serving constituents and upholding the rule of law.

3. Legislators determine their position on bills through various factors, including personal beliefs, constituent preferences, party positions, and input from stakeholders and interest groups.

4. Ghost voting is the practice of legislators voting on behalf of absent colleagues. Pros include increased efficiency and the ability to maintain voting records. Cons include the potential for abuse, lack of transparency, and the possibility of misrepresenting the absent legislator's intent.

5. The Texas House reacted to negative publicity about ghost voting by implementing rules and technological measures to reduce the practice, promoting transparency and accountability.

6. The Texas State Senator's bill requiring disclosure of donors can be seen as a commentary on legislative responsibility, emphasizing the importance of transparency and reducing the influence of undisclosed donors on policy decisions.

7. In both Democratic-controlled and Republican-controlled legislatures in Texas, partisanship plays a significant role in the ability of members to get their bills passed. Members from the majority party generally have an easier time passing their bills, as they enjoy greater support from their fellow party members and often hold key leadership positions that influence the legislative process.

# CHAPTER 10A
1. Texas governors from 1979 until today have had diverse professional backgrounds, including law, business, and politics. However, they have all been members of the two major parties (either Democratic or Republican) and have generally leaned conservative in their political ideologies.

2. The incumbent advantage in gubernatorial races refers to the electoral benefits that sitting governors enjoy, such as increased name recognition, fundraising capabilities, and a track record of accomplishments to tout during their campaigns.

3. Governors are becoming increasingly powerful on the national political stage due to their executive experience, influence within their respective parties, and ability to shape state-level policies that can serve as models for federal legislation.

4. After leaving office, governors often pursue various opportunities, including joining the private sector, working in academia or think tanks, and even running for higher office (such as the presidency).

5. Governors wield various types of power, including executive (e.g., signing or vetoing bills), legislative (e.g., proposing budgets or policies), and appointment (e.g., filling key positions within the state government). Texas governors have relatively weak constitutional powers compared to other states, but they can still exert influence through appointments, agenda-setting, and the use of the bully pulpit.

6. Different states grant their governors different amounts and types of power. Gubernatorial power varies across states, with Texas ranking relatively low in terms of formal powers. One measure used to evaluate this is the "gubernatorial powers index," which takes into account factors such as appointment, budget, and veto powers.

7. The term “plural executive” refers to a system where executive power is distributed among multiple elected officials, rather than being centralized in the hands of a single governor. This concept originated in response to concerns about the concentration of power and has implications for political power in Texas, as it leads to a diffusion of authority and requires collaboration among various officeholders.

# CHAPTER 10B
1. The "plural executive" in Texas refers to the distribution of executive power among multiple elected officials. This system can be likened to "mavericks loose on the range," as it allows for more independent action and decision-making among officeholders, who are not necessarily beholden to the governor or a centralized authority.

2. The legislative powers of the Lieutenant Governor in Texas include presiding over the Senate and influencing the legislative agenda. Executive powers include serving on various boards and commissions and stepping in as acting governor when the governor is out of state or incapacitated.

3. The power of lieutenant governors varies across states, with Texas ranking high in terms of influence. Compared to the governor's powers, the Texas Lieutenant Governor's powers are quite significant, especially in the legislative arena. The ranking is based on factors such as control over the legislative process, committee appointments, and budgetary influence.

4. The Texas Comptroller is responsible for managing the state's finances, including collecting taxes, managing the state treasury, and providing revenue estimates for budgeting purposes.

5. The Texas Land Commissioner oversees the management of state-owned lands and mineral resources, and is responsible for generating revenue from these assets for the Permanent School Fund.

6. State lands in Texas are used to generate revenue for education through activities such as leasing land for oil and gas production, grazing, and timber harvesting. This revenue is directed into the Permanent School Fund, which helps finance public education in the state.

7. The Railroad Commission (RRC) is responsible for regulating the oil and gas industry, pipeline safety, and gas utilities in Texas. The RRC's duties include permitting, inspecting, and enforcing regulations on oil and gas operations. The General Land Office (GLO), on the other hand, is responsible for managing state-owned lands and mineral resources. While both agencies are involved in energy production, the RRC focuses on regulation and safety, while the GLO focuses on land and resource management.

8. The Texas Agricultural Commissioner oversees the Texas Department of Agriculture, which is responsible for promoting and regulating the agricultural industry in the state. This includes duties such as enforcing agricultural laws, supporting economic development, and administering various programs related to food, nutrition, and consumer protection.

9. The Texas Attorney General serves as the chief legal officer for the state, representing Texas in legal matters, providing legal advice to state agencies and officials, and enforcing state laws. The Attorney General is also responsible for protecting consumers, combating fraud, and safeguarding the interests of the state.

10. Attorneys general play a crucial role in increasing the influence of states nationally by advocating for state interests in legal disputes, coordinating efforts among states on multi-state lawsuits, and challenging federal policies and regulations that may impact state sovereignty or authority.

11. Government bureaucracies refer to the administrative structure and personnel responsible for implementing policies and managing public programs. Bureaucratic agencies are the various departments, offices, and organizations within the bureaucracy, while bureaucrats are the individuals who work within these agencies. Over time, government bureaucracies have grown to accommodate the increasing complexity and scope of governmental responsibilities.

12. Bureaucracies hold several advantages over their elected and appointed bosses, including expertise in specific policy areas, institutional memory, continuity of operations, and a longer-term perspective on policy implementation. These advantages often enable bureaucracies to influence policy outcomes and navigate the complexities of government administration.

13. Bureaucracies tend to survive because they provide essential services and expertise that are necessary for the functioning of government. Additionally, their institutional memory and continuity of operations help maintain stability in government, even as elected officials come and go. Bureaucracies also adapt and evolve to address emerging challenges and changing political environments, which contributes to their longevity.
