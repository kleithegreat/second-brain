4. I added the song "You Little Beauty" by FISHER
5. The recording is authentic because it can be found on many different company-populated websites such as Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, Tidal, etc.
6. Venn diagram
7. A tree diagram would better show a chain of influence rather than discrete similarities and differences
8. The diagram makes clear the commonalities between songs better than words since you can see visually what lies between two songs.
9. I provided examples of house music when asked by my group.
10. I evaluated one of my groupmates' suggestion for the theme to be house music by thinking about how it relates to the course and potential songs that might fit that category.
11. One of my group members suggested we do house music as our theme and the rest of the group agreed. Each one of us found a song under the genre of house but with different styles and certain qualities that make them unique.
12. I ensured that communication was respectful between groupmates by just being mindful of what I say myself. All of my groupmates have been respectful without need for intervention.
13. I emphasized the proportion of our final grade that this project is to my groupmates.
14. I helped a groupmate add her song to the group playlist.
