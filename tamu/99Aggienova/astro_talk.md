# notes
- this guy coordinates the foss astropy package
- studies dwarf galaxies and uses data and compares to simulations to understand dark matter?
## galaxies
- galaxies are mostly dark matter
- we try to understand the connection between the matter we can see in galaxies and the dark matter
- dwarf galaxies are the best place to study this because they are the most dark matter dominated
- issue: a bunch of weird transformations we need to do and the many different ways are kinda awkward, so this lead to astropy
- skycoord is a natural way to represent coordinates and transforming them is natural
- astropy is a community driven project
