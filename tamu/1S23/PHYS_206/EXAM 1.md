# Key strategies
---
## General:
- READ CAREFULLY (speed vs velocity)
    - dont forget multiple components when finding speed
- Some questions are simpler than they look
    - simple setup, weird algebra
- BE SPECIFIC with units
    - label which object a variable is describing
    - multiple ts, vs, as, etc
### Tough cases:
- try using different kinematic equations if one isn't working
- try combining different kinematic equations
- try solving for a different unknown

## 2D Motion:
### General
- find t using one component
- relate needed unknowns to given variables
    - try to cancel unknowns and or use unknowns in terms of given variables
    ### Circular motion:
    - never assume constant velocity

## Idiosyncrasies
- when finding d given a graph of a:
    - use multiple integrals and separate where acceleration changes
- max height and time in air depends on initial velocity
