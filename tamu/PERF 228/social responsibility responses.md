1. Case Study: In your own words, **summarize your chosen case (either from this document, from the textbook, or from your own research into electronic music issues). Sticking to facts and a neutral voice, describe the pertinent events and the relevant rights and forms of appropriation involved.** (One paragraph)

DUA LIPA LEVITATING


2. **Argue for one side of the conflict. Explain how one party wronged the other, what should have been done instead, and suggest what should be done to make it right. Consider legal rights as well as ethical principles.** (1–2 paragraphs)




3. **Now argue for the other side of the conflict. Explain what legal or ethical principles could work to defend this party’s actions.** (1–2 paragraphs)



4. Intercultural Competence: **Identify a conflict (or imagine a potential conflict) resulting from cultural/subcultural differences or other differences in personal values.** Explain. Use the same case study you chose for questions 1–3 if you can.




5. Personal Values: **Explain a common scenario in arts or technology in which someone might give or avoid giving money (or another valuable resource) in exchange for some experience engaging with art. Trace what was given or taken and the legal and ethical principles involved. Describe the impact on the community or art form if everyone participated in this way. Discuss whether and how those decisions align with your relevant personal values. Keep each answer relevant to your overall conclusion.** (One page.)
    - For example, you might give an account of donating when it was not required, pirating when it was not authorized, or participating in an act of civil disobedience.
    - Use a generic or hypothetical scenario, or use pseudonyms for the purpose of discussion. The point is not for you to confess any wrongdoing or accuse others. You will be graded on your analysis of the scenarios discussed, not on any particular actions or beliefs described in the scenarios.




6. Defining Social Responsibility in Art: Finally, **considering the information, beliefs, and conclusions above, define social responsibility as it pertains to art using your own words.** (One focused paragraph.)
