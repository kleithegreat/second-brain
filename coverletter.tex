\noindent Mr. Kai Shen, \\

My name is Kevin Lei and I am glad to apply for Google's Software Engineering Internship for Summer 2025.
I am currently a rising junior at Texas A\&M University pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
Having maintained a 4.0 GPA throughout my coursework, such as data structures, analysis of algorithms, computer organization, and machine learning, I am confident in my theoretical background needed for a role in software engineering.


Thank you for your time and consideration. 
I truly believe that my passion for technology and my dedication to learning will make me a valuable addition to Google.
I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my application in further detail, and I am available at your convenience.

\noindent Sincerely, \\
\signaturefont\Large Kevin Lei
