I successfully designed and implemented a 64-bit x86-like RISC processor using Logisim. This project encompassed the full spectrum of processor functionality, including arithmetic operations, logic gates, control flow mechanisms, memory access, and stack operations. The processor adheres to a subset of the x86 instruction set architecture, demonstrating my proficiency in computer architecture and low-level system design. This achievement underscores my capacity to apply theoretical computer science concepts to complex, practical systems.

Currently, I'm developing an environment for training and experimenting with reinforcement learning algorithms applied to poker. This project combines my interests in artificial intelligence, game theory, and software engineering. The environment allows for the implementation and testing of various RL algorithms, providing a platform to explore decision-making strategies in complex, imperfect information scenarios. This ongoing work showcases my ability to tackle interdisciplinary challenges and stay current with emerging technologies in AI and machine learning.
