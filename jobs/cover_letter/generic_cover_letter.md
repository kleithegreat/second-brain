To whom it may concern,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the __POSITION__ at __COMPANY__ for __TIME_PERIOD__.  As a rising junior pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Texas A&M University, I am excited by the opportunity to contribute to __COMPANY__'s mission of __MISSION__.

My academic performance, evidenced by a 4.0 GPA in rigorous courses such as data structures, analysis of algorithms, computer organization, and machine learning, has provided me with a solid theoretical foundation.  However, it is my passion for self-directed learning and innovation that I believe aligns particularly well with __COMPANY__'s culture of __COMPANY_VALUES__. For instance, to enhance my productivity as a developer, I took the initiative to learn Linux and Vim. This self-directed learning not only improved my efficiency but also deepened my understanding of computer systems, which I believe is crucial for developing scalable and efficient software solutions at __COMPANY__.

My drive to exceed expectations is further exemplified by my work with an astronomy research group at Texas A&M. When tasked with creating a basic matplotlib interface for plotting supernova light curves, I saw an opportunity to deliver greater value. I developed a full-fledged Next.js web application with an intuitive user interface, which I then deployed on Vercel to make it accessible to the entire research community. Additionally, I organized all the data in a PostgreSQL database, significantly enhancing data management and accessibility for the team. This project not only showcases my technical skills but also my ability to understand user needs and deliver comprehensive solutions, qualities that I believe are valued at __COMPANY__.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am enthusiastic about the possibility of bringing my passion for technology, dedication to learning, and drive for innovation to __COMPANY__. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss further, and I am available at your convenience.

Sincerely,
Kevin Lei
